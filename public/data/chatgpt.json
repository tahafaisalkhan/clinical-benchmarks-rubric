    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] so jerry is a 45 -year-old male who came in today with an ankle injury jerry what happened\n [patient] hey doctor michael yeah so my son sean i think you met in the past he he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so\n [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way\n [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys\n [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad\n [patient] yeah yes\n [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too\n [patient] yeah a little bit\n [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all\n [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid\n [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches\n [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach\n [doctor] great\n [patient] starting in april so\n [doctor] alright well\n [patient] how long\n [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly\n [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out\n [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do\n [patient] alright thank you doctor\n [doctor] alright thanks",

landscaping\n [doctor] landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements\n [patient] yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out\n [doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers\n [patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger\n [doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no\n [patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too\n [doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand\n [patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left\n [doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption\n [patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends\n [doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that\n [patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean\n [doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed\n [patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand\n [doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or\n [patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it\n [doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right\n [patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side\n [doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that\n [patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips\n [doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side\n [patient] yeah same thing\n [doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time\n [patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate\n [doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you\n [patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start\n [doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do\n [patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep\n [doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] you know if you're looking for like some\n [patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore\n [doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this\n [patient] no i think it's all clear i appreciate it\n [doctor] okay take care and i'll look forward to see you in two weeks\n [patient] very good appreciate your time",

chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you\n [patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] so\n [doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick\n [patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway\n [doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct\n [patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep\n [doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay\n [patient] sure\n [doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerulonephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment\n [patient] how much are all these tests going to cost\n [doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them\n [patient] okay that's that's good to know\n [doctor] yes\n [patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests\n [doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today\n [patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] and right after that i have to go to work\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i\n [doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh\n [patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes\n [doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay\n [patient] got it\n [doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in\n [patient] do i need to get a shot today\n [doctor] no shots today just stopped\n [patient] okay and when do i have to come back for the results\n [doctor] i need you to come back in a week\n [patient] okay can we do that over the phone by the way\n [doctor] we could if if your results are normal but if we need to have additional conversations i'm gon na need you to come back\n [patient] excellent\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] thank you very much\n [doctor] no problem",

collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee\n [patient] mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts\n [doctor] yeah sometimes\n [patient] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like\n [doctor] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts\n [patient] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it\n [doctor] hmmm\n [patient] you actually no\n [doctor] yeah it hurts no\n [patient] what about you i mean are you real weak\n [doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong\n [patient] did you go to the gym\n [doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the\n [patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay\n [doctor] yes sir work harder okay\n [patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school\n [doctor] i did in high school\n [patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids\n [doctor] no\n [patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog\n [doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim\n [patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee\n [doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that\n [patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] it's pretty bad\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] we'll get we'll get to that too\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today\n [doctor] yes\n [patient] okay do i go into that to\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it\n [patient] you're only cup of this\n [doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like\n [patient] hmmm\n [doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up\n [patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] does that make sense\n [doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary\n [patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm\n [doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work\n [patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this\n [doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy\n [patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right\n [doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good\n [patient] did you get did you select you last night\n [doctor] i did\n [patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for\n [doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful\n [patient] are you serious\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] rockets\n [doctor] i live in dallas yes\n [patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls\n [doctor] no no\n [patient] my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you\n [doctor] okay thanks\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] bye\n [patient] you got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight we'll talk about this later okay\n [doctor] yes sir\n [patient] alright very good any questions at all\n [doctor] no\n [patient] okay so",
    "originalNote": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Beverly Howard is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain.\n \n The patient reports that she fell off of a tandem bicycle and struck her right knee on a curb approximately 2 weeks ago. After the injury, she took ibuprofen and treated the wound, but the pain has persisted. She localizes her pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She also reports occasional clicking with full extension of the knee, as well as occasional instability with ambulation. The patient states that her pain is the worst when ambulating up an incline. She denies any previous right knee issues. She enjoys walking her dogs and swimming but has not done this since her injury.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n The patient works in a Children's Hospital.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n SKIN: Warm, dry and intact\n MSK: \n Examination of the right knee: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa is nontender. The epicondyle and posterior aspect of her knee are soft. Popliteal space is nontender. The lateral aspect of her knee is nontender. There is a dime-sized abrasion that is dry and appears to be 1 week old, over the medial patella. No scars. Full extension. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial and lateral collateral ligament are intact. Laxity with posterior drawer testing. 1+ posterior drawer test. Negative Lachman test. Patella tracks fine. No crepitus. Negative McMurray test.\n Examination of the left knee: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial collateral ligament is intact. Lateral collateral ligament is intact.\n \n RESULTS\n \n 4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Right knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.\n \n ORDERS\n \n MRI, right knee\n Prescription medication",

diagnosed with a four . four centimeter left upper lobe nodule biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma molecular testing is pending at this time alright hello beverly how are you\n[patient] i'm good today\n[doctor] you're good today yeah you've been going through a lot lately i know you just had your treatment how how are your symptoms\n[patient] my symptoms are pretty good today i just kind of have a minimal cough and a sore throat\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but that's all i'm feeling today\n[doctor] okay and how about fatigue have you been feeling more tired\n[patient] yes a little bit\n[doctor] okay and how about any nausea or vomiting\n[patient] no not as of today\n[doctor] okay and i know you were mentioning a cough before how is it as far as walking are you having any shortness of breath\n[patient] i have n't noticed any shortness of breath it just kind of seems to be a lingering kind of light dry cough\n[doctor] cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough\n[patient] more dry\n[doctor] a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat\n[patient] this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] to see if it can it you know the dry coughing if it's part of that or what i can do\n[doctor] okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there\n[patient] no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would\n[doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems\n[patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong\n[doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone\n[patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me\n[doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplatin as well as the etoposide and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue\n[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming\n[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplatin and etoposide and the etoposide and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five gray and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far\n[patient] that sounds great thank you\n[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that

diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on\n [patient] doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal\n [doctor] okay how long has that wound been present\n [patient] maybe about a year\n [doctor] a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden\n [patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i went on some antibiotics it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away\n [doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics\n [patient] it's probably been five months\n [doctor] five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on\n [patient] keflex\n [doctor] keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the\n [patient] no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot\n [doctor] alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it\n [patient] lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired\n [doctor] okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend\n [patient] not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do\n [doctor] no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running\n [patient] yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten\n [doctor] okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the\n [patient] yes i think so\n [doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes\n [patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes\n [doctor] okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me\n [patient] i do n't think so\n [doctor] alright so i'll see you back in two weeks and i hope you have fun at the zoo this weekend\n

sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired\n [patient] well since the accident yes\n [doctor] okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately\n [patient] it hurts it hurts\n [doctor] absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that\n [patient] thinking are are you saying i'm thinking\n [doctor] no not by any means i am saying\n [patient] pain i have a lot of pain\n [doctor] yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible\n [patient] said it might be broken\n [doctor] what\n [patient] pamela said it might be broken\n [doctor] if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right\n [patient] okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri\n [doctor] not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin\n [patient] hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl\n [doctor] you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this\n [patient] i ca n't go to work like this\n [doctor] okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay okay any other questions\n [patient] not right now\n [doctor] alright",

long have you had it what's going on with it\n [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed\n [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden\n [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach\n [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics\n [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet\n [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you\n [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly\n [doctor] do n't recall alright\n [patient] something i had taken it before\n [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it\n [patient] i'm sorry\n [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot\n [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance\n [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt\n [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i have n't had that before\n [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled\n [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time\n [doctor] okay do you\n [patient] i'm not really sure how\n [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it\n [patient] i think they told me it was around ten\n [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt\n [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct\n [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening\n [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me\n [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound\n [patient] that sounds great\n [doctor] alright do you have any other question\n [patient] i do if anything happens in between\n [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that\n[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it\n[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics\n[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left\n[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now\n[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point\n[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that\n[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc\n[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park\n[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now\n[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there\n[patient] i do n't feel that right there\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure\n[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture\n[doctor] correct\n[patient] if i heard\n[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy\n[patient] okay sounds good\n[doctor] alright",

sometimes i try to stand up and and and like i i ca n't go get weak or if i'm standing up for too long\n [doctor] okay so would you would you say that there are certain positions that make you feel better or worse\n [patient] yeah like lying on my side makes me feel better\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] and then you said that standing also makes it worse right\n [patient] yeah if i stand for a while\n [doctor] okay and then have you experienced any like loss of control of like your bladder or your bowels\n [patient] yeah i pooped myself once\n [doctor] okay so incontinence just once though like over the last two years right it's not like a consistent thing\n [patient] no it's not consistent i think i stood up for too long i think i was drinking too\n [doctor] okay okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like what were they\n [patient] so i i had a doc gave me some injections before i'm not sure what they were though\n [doctor] okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective\n [patient] no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it\n [doctor] okay but did the did the exercises help\n [patient] i mean i guess a little\n [doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications\n [patient] yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was\n [doctor] okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now\n [patient] i mean i sit at home all day\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] watch tv\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] so not very active i've gained about eighty pounds the past year\n [doctor] okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions\n [patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis\n [doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad\n [patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though\n [doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking\n [patient] what type of smoking\n [doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] have you smoked\n [patient] next maybe that i have n't\n [doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before\n [patient] okay i smoked\n [doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it\n [patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked\n [doctor] okay you have\n [patient] too many questions are you the fit\n [doctor] i'm your doctor i have to\n [patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question\n [doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things\n [patient] sent them off yeah\n [doctor] pardon\n [patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen\n [doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt\n [patient] yeah it hurts\n [doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt\n [patient] a little bit\n [doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up\n [patient] stop\n [doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the\n [patient] what does that mean like am i dying\n [doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay\n [patient] that's a big word\n [doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something\n [patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that\n [doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] can i get pain pills too\n [doctor] can you\n [patient] for pain\n [doctor] can you get what now\n [patient] pain pills\n [doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have\n [patient] i'd say it was n't effective\n [doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective\n [patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked\n [doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery\n [patient] i do n't want i know\n [doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] do you have any questions\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection\n [doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay thank you",

At times his pain will radiate down his left lower extremity. He also reports experiencing intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his pain and makes him feel weak. He is able to get some pain relief when laying on his side. In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day. He has gained 80 lbs over the last year.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n Patient reports previously playing basketball, but he is now not very active and sits at home all day. He has a history of smoking, but denies smoking currently.\n \n FAMILY HISTORY\n \n Patient reports his 4th cousin has scoliosis.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Genitourinary: Denies bowel or bladder changes.\n Musculoskeletal: Reports back pain.\n \n VITALS\n \n Oxygen saturation is in 95 percentile range.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No Murmur.\n NEURO: Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.\n MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness along the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Positive supine straight leg raise.\n \n RESULTS\n \n The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed. This shows evidence of disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Chronic lumbar back pain.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I explained to the patient that he has a herniated disc at L4-5 with radiculopathy. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis as well as treatment options. I have recommended that we start with a spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will return for follow-up after to assess his progress after his spinal injection.",

okay that's fine have you measured your blood pressure recently at all\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay are you still taking your medication because i see you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril\n [patient] yeah most days i remember\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] ra i'm not suspicious but we're just gon na go with that okay because looking at your vitals it it is of still a bit high i'm not really comfortable i see like a hundred and eighty over you know eighty and\n [doctor] that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars\n [patient] i think they're little bit better\n [doctor] okay what makes you think that have you been taking them\n [patient] yeah i check it you know most days again kinda when i remember\n [doctor] okay how often are you checking it\n [patient] i would say four five times a week\n [doctor] okay you might wan na switch to maybe two or three times a day but you know that's something i'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] alright how is your diet\n [patient] kinda the same as my exercise decent could be better\n [doctor] alright and okay not a problem so what is your do you are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros are you just eating what you feel like\n [patient] yeah just trying to watch what i eat more than anything but nothing specific\n [doctor] okay and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet\n [patient] no just trying to watch my carbs a little bit more but not counting or anything\n [doctor] alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt\n [patient] little bit\n [doctor] okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright can you bend your knee and straighten it\n [patient] i can i think that's all i can i can bend\n [doctor] mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight\n [patient] i can but i have a little bit of a limp\n [doctor] okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions\n [patient] sounds good\n [doctor] alright awesome",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Right knee injury.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n William Russell is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n \n Approximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.\n \n In terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.\n \n His diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake. He has also been taking his metformin 500 mg as prescribed.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.\n \n VITALS\n \n Blood pressure: 180/80 mmHg\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.\n RESPIRATORY:\n Lungs are clear bilaterally.\n MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild tenderness to palpation at the lateral aspect. Ecchymosis and edema along the lateral aspect. No effusion. Decent range of motion. Pain with movement.\n \n RESULTS\n \n X-rays of the right knee were obtained and reviewed. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n 1. Right knee pain, lateral ligament strain.\n 2. Hypertension.\n 3. Diabetes type 2.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.\n \n For his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.\n \n For his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.",

and so they they had you come in so can you tell me what happened how's all that going for you\n [patient] sure i've been having some back pain on my right side it's been lasting for about a week now\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i also started to see some blood in my urine\n [doctor] okay so on the right side so does that pain does it move anywhere or is it just kinda stay in that that one area\n [patient] yeah it's moved down a little bit on to my right lower side a little bit\n [doctor] side okay so how would you describe the pain is it constant or is does it come and go\n [patient] it's pretty constant\n [doctor] okay did you notice any pain when you're urinating i know i know you say you you saw you see blood but any pain with that\n [patient] no no real pain when i'm when i'm peeing at all\n [doctor] okay so have you taken anything i know have you tried like azo or any of that to\n [patient] i took some ibuprofen that helped a little bit\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] but it still hurts even with ibuprofen\n [doctor] alright have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills\n [patient] i have n't thrown up but i felt a little bit nauseated\n [doctor] little nauseated yeah that's we expected so have you do you have a family history of kidney stones i know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff but\n [patient] yeah my my dad had kidney stones i think he has passed a couple of them i'm not quite sure\n [doctor] alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one\n [patient] this is my first time i've never had this before\n [doctor] okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that\n [patient] yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone\n [doctor] okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain\n [patient] not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them\n [doctor] okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt\n [patient] a little bit yeah\n [doctor] a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far\n [patient] probably not enough i drink some but\n [doctor] okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me\n [patient] no i do n't think so\n [doctor] alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright",
    "originalNote": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Anna Diaz is a pleasant 29-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right-sided back pain.\n \n For approximately 1 week, the patient has been experiencing constant right-sided back pain that radiates down to her lower right side, as well as hematuria and nausea. Her primary care physician was concerned for possible kidney stones and subsequently referred her here for further evaluation. She denies any pain with urination or vomiting, but admits that she has likely not been drinking enough water. The only treatment she has tried so far is ibuprofen with minimal pain relief. Although she denies any personal history of kidney stones prior to this occurrence, she explains that her father has had kidney stones in the past.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Constitutional: Negative for fever.\n Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea. Negative for vomiting.\n Genitourinary: Positive for hematuria\n \n VITALS\n \n Vitals are normal.\n Blood pressure is normal.\n Heart rate is normal.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n GI/GU: Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA located near her flank with tenderness on the right.\n \n RESULTS\n \n CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Kidney stone, right side.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, I discussed the findings with the patient. The CT scan revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the proximal right ureter. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids, as much as possible, to help facilitate passing of the stone. She was provided with a urine strainer so she can see if and when the stone passes. Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy. This procedure was explained to the patient.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n Follow up in 2 weeks.",

    "originalDialogue": "[patient] hi kenneth how are you the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain yeah i was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since\n [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then\n [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend\n [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it\n [patient] it's my right knee\n [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened\n [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards\n [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance\n [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore\n [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before\n [patient] no that was the first time\n [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake\n [patient] lake martin\n [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier\n [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can\n [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day\n [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway\n [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked\n [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days\n [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing\n [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it\n [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all\n [patient] no just the swelling and the pain\n [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain\n [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day\n [doctor] okay and\n [patient] putting a cold pack on it\n [doctor] okay and has that helped at all\n [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though\n [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here\n [patient] i had my tonsils out\n [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press\n [patient] yeah that's sore\n [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt\n [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore\n [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that\n [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan\n [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions\n [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me\n [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye\n [patient] thank you",

exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put it into my chart okay and i'll explain what those things mean so on my exam you've got no jvd there is no swelling in your neck no

extremity exam you've got one plus nonpitting edema on both of your lower extremities on your on your ankles no calf tenderness no negative homan sign so what does all this mean so basically you've got you know you've got some sort of infection or something going on in your lungs that i can hear right now the rest of your exam is pretty much stable it's unchanged from before so let's talk about what we what we should do about this so for the for the first problem with the shortness of breath the first thing i wan na do is go ahead and get a chest x-ray for you okay you've been coughing up blood i also wan na send you to the emergency department to get some blood testing done i'm worried about a blood clot or something else going on so i wan na get a cat scan of your chest as well so i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to the emergency department i'll call them and and have you head over that way they can get a chest x-ray and a cat scan and some blood work as well and then we'll evaluate why you're having the shortness of breath and why you're coughing up this blood okay and then depending on what they find you may need you know it could be as simple as a pneumonia or it could be something a little bit more serious we may have to get you know start you know depending on what you find we will get the right treatment started any questions about that or can you drive to the emergency department from here or is that okay\n [patient] yeah i can bike no problem i have no question\n [doctor] alright for the second problem for the diabetes since your blood sugar is running a little bit high once you get over this i'm blood sugars running a little bit high once we get you over this hump of the shortness of breath and get this diagnosed i'm gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c today we will probably increase your dose of metformin from five hundred twice a day to seven fifty twice a day so why do n't we do that and then why do n't we have we'll have the hemoglobin a1c back and then we can once you get over this illness that you're undergoing we'll we'll we'll discuss that more i'll have you come back in about three weeks to just discuss your diabetes and what our treatment plan will be for that okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] for the high blood pressure definitely hold off on the norvasc for right now let's figure out what's going what's causing this episode of shortness of breath i want some blood testing done and and once we have that under better control we can reassess your blood pressure so right now hold the norvasc and then we'll have you come back once everything is done okay\n [patient] no\n [doctor] any other questions or anything we know if we need to talk about today\n [patient] no i'm good\n [doctor] sounds good

dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though\n [patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them\n [doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of cisplatin and etoposide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that\n [patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay\n [doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation pneumonitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five gray yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before\n [patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight\n [doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright so we will get you those medications those prescriptions and then we will see you back in two weeks\n [patient] okay great thank you\n [doctor] thanks",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Kidney stones.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.\n \n VITALS\n \n Vitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n MSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right side.\n \n RESULTS\n \n The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Right kidney stone.\n \n PLAN\n \n We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy.",

i do see that you know the nurse took your your vital signs this morning that your blood pressure is running quite a bit high it was like one seventy two over ninety eight so that's that's really a little higher than where we want it to be especially that you're on your medication but what we're gon na do is we're gon na take i'm gon na take a look at you real quick and then we can discuss you

have to talk about maybe they can look at you know some some diet changes as well so the other thing is for your for your blood sugar here i see that you know you're running a bit high as well it looks like you're like you're about one seventy this morning and i i i i assume that you were fasting last night is that right okay so that's that's a little higher than what we want it's not bad it's below two hundred but it's getting kinda close to the borderline from where our limit is so we will take we take a look at that and also we'll figure out what we can do with that as well alright so at this point how about are you how is how is work how is life it's been good otherwise how's the family\n [patient] they are good i did eat a lot of my kids easter candy over the weekend so maybe that's why my sugar is high\n [doctor] okay alright great alright alright just just around easter okay not not too much during the the year hopefully\n [patient] yeah i try\n [doctor] well that's good so

looks good it's with it's within normal limits here and then your oxygenation is fine so you did mention you did n't have any shortness of breath so that's good so let me just feel around your neck

so on your auscultation of your lungs they're clear bilaterally on your heart exam though i i do sense a two out of six systolic ejection murmur now that was also there last year so it has n't changed any so we'll just keep monitoring that one and then let me take a look at your extremities here real quick theresa so let me look at your hands you got a little bit of slight edema bilaterally on your upper extremities but let me look at your legs here okay so you have a one plus pitting edema noted here on your legs bilaterally so that means you're retaining a lot of that salt that you're eating unfortunately okay so so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here so definitely what you're experiencing is some uncontrolled hypertension now most of the time you know it's multifactorial right it's your diet it could be the medication regimen if you're not following that and then it might be that we are gon na need to change the medication around and also change your diet but i would like to start with going ahead and i want to continue your current medication regimen today i do wan na really encourage that you do take that everyday maybe set a reminder like on

may like that you can actually use as an alternative besides the mcdonald's although you can have that once in a blue moon but you know not not too often okay\n [patient] okay sounds good\n [doctor] great and then for your diabetes i wan na go ahead and let's go ahead and increase your your metformin to fifteen hundred milligrams i think all for that too i want you to go ahead and continue taking your blood sugars to make sure as as you normally would to make sure that you know that change in medication is is actually being effective alright do you have any other questions for me at this

an inferior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing\n [patient] well i mean it was a real shock for me i thought everything was fine after my last heart attack and

i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling\n [patient] i have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital\n [doctor] okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep\n [patient] yeah i mean i always use a couple of pillows you know i maybe i've had to sit up a little bit more but i mean for the most part i think it's pretty normal\n [doctor] okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed\n [patient] yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah\n [doctor] yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake\n [patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] i love pizza it's my favorite food\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food\n [doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza\n [patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables\n [doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right\n [patient] i know i know i'm gon na work on it\n [doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well\n [patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active\n [doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound\n [patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you\n [doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright thank you",

alright yeah that that that definitely makes sense so how would you describe the pain is it like a dull pain is it stabbing what what would you say\n [patient] it it's a pretty sharp pain\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] anytime i move\n [doctor] okay and does it radiate down your arm or does it stay in that one spot\n [patient] it radiates down the forearm\n [doctor] radiates down the forearm alright so have you taken any medications for it to make it better\n [patient] i tried taking advil couple of days but i usually just forget about it\n [doctor] okay when you took it did it did it help at all did it change your your pain score\n [patient] yeah i i think it helped some\n [doctor] okay that's good alright so we'll we'll do a physical exam on that elbow we'll take a look at it in a second but i do wan na talk to you about your your hypertension you came in today i know you have past medical history of hypertension came in today your blood pressure's a little bit high it was a one fifty over seven over ninety which is pretty high today i see you're on twenty of lisinopril have you been taking that daily\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay so maybe you just have a little little white coat syndrome i know i have that myself and even though i'm a physician i i still do n't like to go to the doctor so i definitely understand how about your diet i know we talked a little bit about that before and you said kinda during the pandemic you fell off a little bit how you been doing that have you been lowering your salt intake\n [patient] yeah but i only eat low salt items avoid adding salt to food kind of the whole whole family follows like a you know like a mediterranean diet\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] we try to be pretty good about it\n [doctor] okay yeah that's good that that's that's definitely good yeah i know a lot of people during the pandemic it was you know sitting at home and and eating more than we should but that's i'm very happy that you've been compliant and you have that low salt diet so let's talk about your diabetes i think you see here on on five hundred of metformin are you taking that as well daily\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay and your blood sugars how have they been\n [patient] since i do n't take insulin i do n't check it everyday when i have checked it it's usually running somewhere between eighty to a hundred\n [doctor] okay yeah that's that's really good yeah so i that's that's pretty good so what we're gon na do we're gon na get a a1c just to see you know that range and it's possibility we can we can you know lower that metformin dosage but we will do that after your visit then we will take a look at that so lem me go ahead and will do that quick exam of your elbow but first i want to make sure you're not having any chest pain or anything like that\n [patient] no\n [doctor] no belly pain\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright so listen to your lungs so your lungs are clear bilaterally listen to your heart so your heart exam you do still have that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur but we know it about that before so let me take a look at your elbow so when i press right here on the back of your elbow is that painful\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] alright so when i have you you you flex and extend it it's painful does that does that hurt\n [patient] yes it does\n [doctor] alright so your right elbow exam shows you have pain to palpation of the olecranon area of the posterior elbow you do have mild pain with flexion and extension but you do have also normal range of motion at that elbow so we we did do an x-ray before you came in and luckily nothing's broken no fracture no bony abnormality so it's a normal x-ray which is really good so let me just talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have a elbow contusion i believe your son did hit you with the lacrosse stick and it caused that that pain i see some swelling little inflammation there as well you have a little bit of a bruise i think that's that's what happened so for that i know you're having some pain i'm gon na prescribe you eight hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that twice a day and that should help with some of that swelling and pain i also want you to ice it three times a day for twenty minutes at a time that should also help with the swelling and pain and just for the time being for the next couple of weeks just you know maybe you know not play lacrosse with your son just to help that heal then you can get back on on the field so for your your high blood pressure we're just gon na keep you on the hypertension we'll just keep you on that twenty milligrams of lisinopril looks like you're doing great with that and your diet and then for your diabetes we will keep you on the five hundred milligrams of metformin and we will also get a a1c just to check your levels and see if we do need to adjust the medication in the future alright so do you have any questions for me\n [patient] no sounds good\n [doctor] alright so we will see you next time and my nurse will be in with those prescriptions\n [patient] alright thank you",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today\n [patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse\n [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there\n [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time\n [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version\n [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden\n [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at\n [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month\n [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes\n [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here\n [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me\n [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg\n [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life\n [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten\n [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better\n [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today\n [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs\n [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well\n [doctor] that's okay\n [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day\n [doctor] absolutely\n [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them\n [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here\n [patient] no it's right here\n [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there\n [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks\n [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please\n [patient] okay that's it that's all i got\n [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan\n [patient] sure sounds good\n [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you",
    "originalNote": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Matthew Hill is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an \"electrical tooth ache\" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back. The patient denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has attempted NSAIDs in the past without relief. He has also attended physical therapy.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n CONSTITUTIONAL: Vitals look good.\n MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No bony abnormalities. No redness. No bruising present. Pain with palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Positive for pain with flexion and extension of the back. 4/5 strength on the left, 5/5 strength on the right. Reflexes are brisk. Motor and sensory are intact throughout the bilateral lower extremities.\n \n RESULTS\n \n The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed a disc herniation at the level of the L4-5 vertebrae. It is associated with some nerve root impingement.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Acute disc herniation at L4-5 with nerve root impingement.\n \n PLAN\n \n I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a epidural steroid injection and formal physical therapy. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a epidural steroid injection into the lumbar spine today. He will follow up with me in 4 weeks to check on his progress.",

yes\n[doctor] okay and did it was it swollen afterwards or is it looks a little bit swollen right now\n[patient] yeah little bit swollen yeah\n[doctor] okay so so far have you taken anything for the pain\n[patient] just taking some ibuprofen just for some swelling\n[doctor] okay that's it what would you say your pain score is a out of ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt\n[patient] i would say that when i'm stationary i do n't really feel a lot of pain but if i start doing some mobility i would say probably a four five\n[doctor] about a four okay and how long ago did you say this was is this happened this injury\n[patient] it's been a week now\n[doctor] a week okay alright alright so we will take a look i'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly\n[patient] yes i have\n[doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that\n[patient] i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes\n[doctor] okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today\n[patient] no\n[doctor] are you any belly pain\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no shortness of breath just wan na make sure\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so i'm just gon na listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any wheezes or crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do still hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and you already had that and so we we knew about that already so lem me look at your knee here so when i press here on the inside of your knee does that hurt\n[patient] a little bit\n[doctor] little bit how about when i press on the outs the outside gon na press on the outside is that painful\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no alright so i'm gon na have you flex your knee is that painful\n[patient] yeah that's uncomfortable\n[doctor] that's uncomfortable and extend it so that's painful\n[patient] yeah yes\n[doctor] okay so on your knee exam i i see that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of your right knee you have some pain with flexion extension i also identify some edema around the knee and some effusion you have a little bit of fluid in there as well so prior to coming in we did do an x-ray of that right knee and luckily you did n't break anything so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have what we call a mcl strain so a medial collateral ligament strain so when you fell i think you twisted a little bit and so it irritated you strained that that ligament there so for that what we can do for you first i'm gon na prescribe you some ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams and you can take that twice a day and that's gon na help you with that swelling and that pain that you currently do have i'm also gon na put you in a a knee brace just to try and support those muscles to allow it to heal and then i want you to ice the knee you can do that for twenty minutes at a time for three to four times a day that should also help with the the swelling of your knee for your hypertension now i'm gon na keep you on that twenty of lisinopril okay because you are taking it and you you're doing pretty good with it i also want to get you a referral to nutrition just to try to help you with that diet you know because right now you are your diet is little bit out of control so we just need to rain you in a little bit and hopefully you know with their help we can eventually get you off that lisinopril alright so do you have any questions for me\n[patient] do i need to elevate my leg or stay off my leg or\n[doctor] yeah i would yeah you can elevate your leg stay off your stay off your leg you know if you have any kids have them work out in the yard instead of you just to to for a couple of weeks

metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise\n [patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but\n [doctor] sure\n [patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay\n [doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that\n [patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff\n [doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all\n [patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though\n [doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while\n [patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related\n [doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today\n [patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think\n [doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so\n [patient] these are like my video visit exams\n [doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything\n [patient] no i i think i'm okay you gave me a year's worth of refills last time we were together\n [doctor] okay sounds great alright thanks gabriel good seeing you again\n [patient] good to see you thanks",

play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee\n [doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen\n [patient] about three days ago\n [doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that\n [patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited\n [doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging\n [patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down\n [doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain\n [patient] anti-inflammatories\n [doctor] okay alrighty and did that help\n [patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now\n [doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then\n [patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened\n [doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all\n [patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal\n [doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there\n [patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee\n [doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel\n [patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end\n [doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam 15 milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan\n [patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately\n [doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright and how's your dog you has it been jogging with you before this incident\n [patient] how's just how's my dog or how is my job\n [doctor] your your dog\n [patient] my my my dog is okay\n [doctor] good\n [patient] is doing really well and and he enjoys still playing around outside but looks like wo n't be able to do that for a little bit\n [doctor] very good alright well i'm gon na go ahead and have the nurse take you to the scheduler to get your mri and i'll get back with you as soon as we get the results of that\n [patient] okay sounds good thank you\n [doctor] thank you",

He states that he is able to bend his knee with pain towards the end of this motion; however, when he goes to straighten his knee, he feels like he has to help it straight.

fourteen i was a really good gymnast back then really good\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i was doing a back summer salt and i felt a pop then and then since that time i've really had problems with my knee\n [doctor] uh uh\n [patient] but you know the athlete that i am i can still really ski very well so i just kept going\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i'm really tough my pain tolerance is very high\n [doctor] okay okay okay how so do you have any other exercises that i might wan na know about outside of intense gym and ski events\n [patient] no i think that's about it\n [doctor] okay and how frequently do you normally ski\n [patient] i ski probably three times a week\n [doctor] okay and then are you on any medications at this time other than the thc\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay alright what\n [patient] nothing no\n [doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay and when i press on the outside of your left of your right knee sorry does that hurt\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay alright so when i move your your kneecap does that hurt\n [patient] no it kinda makes a shooting pain down to my ankle though\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] but it does n't hurt my knee\n [doctor] okay so does the pain radiate frequently\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i've never really noticed it just messed with my kneecap\n [doctor] okay alright on your skin exam i do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee are you able to bend it\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay and then when you walked in on your gait i think i think i did appreciate a slight limp are you i i i i think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar\n [patient] yeah i waddle pretty pretty good now\n [doctor] okay alright and when you move your knee away from your body you're bending like your you're pulling it towards me does that hurt\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright so pain on dorsiflexion but not on plantar flexion plantar flexion okay alright so what we are gon na do right now i think i'm gon na look at your x-rays but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray i do not appreciate any fracture what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis and that could explain like why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during like windy weather and what not so this is what we're gon na do for my assessment and plan right the first thing is i think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament what that means is what that will mean for you though is that we are gon na continue to brace your right knee that's gon na hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since you're limping i am going to recommend you for physical therapy i think it would be an i think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now and i think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were fourteen i'm gon na prescribe you some medications i do n't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time but the medications i'm gon na give you are gon na be meloxicam fifteen milligrams you're gon na take that once a day that will help with like the swelling and the bruising i'm also gon na prescribe you just like a higher strength nsaid so ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee i think you are i think you just kind of like strength a little bit but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing i think you just take it easy on your body i know that you're like very active from what i hear and i i think that that's really exciting but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break you'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy but you know let the yeah let your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] alright do you have any questions right now\n [patient] no thank you so much\n [doctor] no problem",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Right knee injury.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Elizabeth Ross is a pleasant 91-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of her pain began 2 weeks ago, when she was downhill skiing. She states she ran into a tree and twisted her right knee. At the time of the injury, she also heard a pop in her left knee, however she denies left knee pain. The patient locates her pain to the medial aspect of her right knee. Currently, her pain level is 7 out of 10, however she notes this can reach an 11 out of 10 at times with prolonged ambulation. The patient states that her pain has been slowly increasing over the last few days. She experiences limping with ambulation. The patient states that her pain lasts for as long as she is ambulating. She denies radiating pain. She also reports constant swelling and stiffness in the morning. Her stiffness will resolve with ambulation. The patient has been wearing a brace and using THC cream, which has been helpful. She denies taking any medications for pain, however she has been utilizing THC gummies, which have been beneficial.\n \n The patient has a history of a right knee reconstruction when she was 14 years old. She states that she was a good gymnast at that time. The patient adds that she has had problems with her right knee since that time. She denies any other exercises outside of intense gym and ski events. The patient states that she normally skis 3 times per week.\n \n SURGICAL HISTORY\n \n The patient reports a history of total right knee reconstruction at the age of 14.\n \n MEDICATIONS\n \n She denies needing medications.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, swelling, and stiffness. Denies left knee pain.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild effusion. The patient ambulated with an antalgic gait. Pain with dorsiflexion, but not with plantarflexion.\n \n RESULTS\n \n 4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures. There is development of mild arthritis.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n 1. Right knee posterior cruciate ligament strain.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.\n \n Regarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.",

    "originalDialogue": "[patient] alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on\n [doctor] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever\n [patient] wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms\n [doctor] you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot\n [patient] okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or\n [doctor] urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room\n [patient] wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for\n [doctor] you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week\n [patient] mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm\n [doctor] you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay\n [patient] alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay\n [doctor] no i do n't do that\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] none of us do\n [patient] okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either\n [doctor] no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick\n [patient] alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him\n [doctor] you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load\n [patient] mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings\n [doctor] yeah there is actually ten of us\n [patient] wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings\n [doctor] yeah i'm okay\n [patient] maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place\n [doctor] yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family\n [patient] you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies\n [doctor] no no i have never had any problems with allergies\n [patient] okay and do you smoke\n [doctor] i do n't smoke\n [patient] do you live with anybody who does\n [doctor] i do not\n [patient] okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions\n [doctor] yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick\n [patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help\n [doctor] okay it does\n [patient] alright\n [doctor] thank you\n [patient] okay no problem\n [doctor] alright",

you mister edwards i'm doctor\n [doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you\n [patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that\n [doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area\n [patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face\n [doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face\n [patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face\n [doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it\n [patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes\n [doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it\n [patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you\n [doctor] pain excess\n [patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work\n [doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon\n [patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain\n [doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes\n [patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know\n [doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different\n [patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten\n [doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you\n [patient] sure\n [doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth\n [patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that\n [doctor] yep\n [patient] you can hear it on the other side as well\n [doctor] yep\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay\n [patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side\n [doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal\n [patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp\n [doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it\n [patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin\n [doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first\n [patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve\n [doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this\n [patient] sure\n [doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic\n [patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you\n [doctor] okay sounds good let's do it\n [patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain\n [doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not\n [patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up\n [doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there\n [patient] great i'll see you

Denies left sided facial pain. Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in the right cheek. Denies right sided facial weakness.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n Neurological\n - Orientation: Light touch testing of the right side of the face reveals numbness when compared to the contralateral side. Pinprick testing is sharp on the left side of the face; dull on the right side of the face.\n \n Ears, Nose, Mouth, and Throat\n Bilateral finger rub test is negative.\n - Examination of Mouth: Teeth are symmetric.\n \n RESULTS\n \n MRI of the head is reviewed today. This demonstrates a small blood vessel that is abutting, and perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve.\n \n ASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n \n 1. Trigeminal neuralgia.\n - Medical Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing facial pain for 2 to 3 months. A recent MRI revealed a small blood vessel abutting, or perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve. The root cause of his facial pain is the compression of the blood vessel against this nerve.\n - Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed treatment options including medicating with gabapentin or Tegretol. I explained the common side effects associated with these medications can include memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. We discussed the need for genetic testing due to the possible side effect of dermatologic reactions in people of East Asian descent. We also briefly discussed surgical treatment to decompress the nerve, but this is not recommended at this time.\n - Medical Treatment: A prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the patientâ€™s pharmacy.\n \n Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up with me in 1 month. If at that time his facial pain persists, we may further discuss surgical options.",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on\n [patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay\n [doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta\n [patient] yes and and fish oil\n [doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that\n [patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy\n [doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so\n [patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents\n [doctor] yep\n [patient] how long do i have to have that in there\n [doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging\n [patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then\n [doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time\n [patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to\n [doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies\n [patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] fasting\n [doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking\n [patient] i thought it was close to sixteen\n [doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet\n [patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results\n [doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist\n [patient] oh\n [doctor] that's your kidney doctor\n [patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago\n [doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil\n [patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out\n [doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span\n [patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan\n [doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again\n [patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches\n [doctor] you can take tylenol\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] alright that sounds good\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications\n [doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause\n [patient] yeah i do have that\n [doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] okay for your\n [patient] sounds really good\n [doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] any questions\n [patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad\n [doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others\n [patient] no no i just feel kinda down\n [doctor] you feel kinda down what's your\n [patient] life sucks\n [doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like\n [patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely\n [doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out\n [patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time\n [doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay\n [patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you\n [doctor] okay you're welcome anything else\n [patient] so you will do the medication refill do i so that's automatic\n [doctor] yep i'm gon na put them into the computer and and whatever pharmacy you want yep mm-hmm\n [patient] okay alright sounds great thank you\n [doctor] okay you're welcome i'll be in touch bye\n [patient] okay alright bye-bye",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] okay\n [patient] good morning\n [doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it\n [patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today\n [doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo\n [patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it\n [doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were\n [patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now\n [doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler\n [patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night\n [doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports\n [patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens\n [doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too\n [patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] does it does it alleviate the problem\n [doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening\n [patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] for the symptoms\n [doctor] yes\n [patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so\n [doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack\n [patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening\n [doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout\n [patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems\n [doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense\n [patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having\n [doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do\n [patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation\n [doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too\n [patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] and then we can talk a little bit more\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] and everything sounds good\n [doctor] let me take a look at your eyes\n [patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that\n [doctor] yeah i think so yeah\n [patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal\n [doctor] awesome\n [patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it\n [doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that\n [patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you\n [doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year\n [patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too\n [doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay\n [patient] thank you",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] so donna is a 37 -year-old female she is here with complaint of headache she has a history of hypertension and diabetes so donna tell me what's going on\n [patient] yeah lately i've just been having quite a bit of a headache and i mean every now and then i'll get it but lately it's just been getting worse and i've noticed that my blood pressure has been running high i've been taking it maybe like once a week but the past three weeks it's been really high than usual so i was a little worried\n [doctor] do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings\n [patient] yeah so one of them was like one sixty over eighty seven and then the last one was like one seventy five over ninety two\n [doctor] okay so it's really high i was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is one twenty four over eighty two have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lisinopril that you've been prescribed\n [patient] i have but sometimes i forget i'm i'm embarrassed to tell you that but yeah sometimes i forget i get busy like especially on the weekends i'm very good during the week but on the weekends i tend to forget it and that's when i'm most busy too\n [doctor] yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar\n [patient] yeah i have because i thought maybe you know that's why i'm getting the headaches maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high but my sugar has been okay it's been running like one twenty sometimes it does get down to like one hundred\n [doctor] okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that\n [patient] not really so much it's it's been pretty much the same but pretty normal\n [doctor] okay and when you get these headaches what are you taking for them\n [patient] well i take my tylenol hoping it'll just you know go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it it just goes throughout the day and i start to get them again\n [doctor] okay and when you first had the headaches what would you rate the headache at zero no pain ten the worst pain ever\n [patient] i would say when i first get them it's about i would say a seven out of ten\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] and then after you take the tylenol what does it go down to\n [patient] it goes down to probably about a four maybe five it i still feel it i still feel annoying but it's not as pounding as as it normally would be\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] if i did n't take the tylenol\n [doctor] yeah and have you ever had headaches like this before\n [patient] not like this you know you know as you know sometimes i get migraine but i know i never really take anything for it that's like once a year or once or every two years but not like not like this one headaches like this one\n [doctor] okay and have you had any congestion anything like that cough runny nose\n [patient] yeah i thought maybe because you know now it's springtime and i tend to get my allergies but it it's it's very different and i've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache\n [doctor] okay if you tap on your forehead do you have any tenderness\n [patient] right here\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] just a little not really too much\n [doctor] okay if you tap down here on these bones your cheek bones any tenderness there\n [patient] a little bit not as much as i guess if i tap up here\n [doctor] okay and then if you kinda push on your neck around here any tenderness\n [patient] it it's a little tender but it's not it is a little bit i'd say\n [doctor] okay okay so you do n't have any frontal sinus tenderness no maxillary sinus tenderness it sounds like you do n't have any lymphadenopathy that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender so yeah you know let's just talk about a few things that i wan na do and then i want you to actually come in and and be seen by doctor ruth so first off your headache i think taking tylenol is great you can keep taking that you know your lisinopril you're on twenty milligrams once a day which is a medium dose but i think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches i'm gon na have you increase your lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] and then i want you to keep checking your blood pressure and i wan na order some blood tests i'd like to get some just normal blood work we'll get a hemoglobin a1c some laboratory tests things like that and and then for your diabetes i'm gon na have some diabetic education for you that i want you to be able to review it sounds like your blood sugar has been running a little bit high and after you get

i'm sorry you're having headaches well let's talk about it but i would like to record this conversation with this app that's gon na help me focus on you more would that be okay with you\n [patient] yes that's okay\n [doctor] okay great thanks so carolyn tell me about your headache and headache or headaches when did when did they start and and what symptoms are you having\n [patient] my headache started about a week ago it's feeling like a dull pain in the back of my head i have flushing in my ears they get really red and hot and sometimes i just feel a little bit dizzy when i get these headaches but i've taken tylenol and advil and it's not really going away it just keeps coming back\n [doctor] okay and alright and so this started about a week ago has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what\n [patient] it comes and goes i it it's relieved when i take my tylenol or advil but then it comes right back\n [doctor] hmmm okay and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening is there anything else that makes it better or worse\n [patient] it's definitely worse in the evening\n [doctor] okay and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else\n [patient] yes no just in the back of my head\n [doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what\n [patient] i've been under a lot of stress lately so maybe about when some stress started occurring\n [doctor] okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache\n [patient] no no fever\n [doctor] okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay and have you had headaches like this before\n [patient] i have\n [doctor] okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say\n [patient] no it's not\n [doctor] okay alright and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low one hundreds or two hundreds or what\n [patient] i have n't been checking my blood sugars\n [doctor] really okay well we will get you back on that and and we can talk about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last visit are you still taking that\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay great and okay you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise\n [patient] i have not been eating well because i've been stressed over the last week but i have n't been exercising for maybe the past week but generally i've been doing better\n [doctor] okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what\n [patient] yes it has\n [doctor] okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being\n [patient] not lately\n [doctor] being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it\n [patient] i did\n [doctor] yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or\n [patient] i am\n [doctor] carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful\n [patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to\n [doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me\n [patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better\n [doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you\n [patient] no no i think it's just stress\n [doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you\n [patient] thank you\n [doctor] sure",

and you went one way and your knee did n't\n [patient] i did fall to the ground\n [doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on\n [patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on\n [doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question\n [patient] not really\n [doctor] no\n [patient] he does n't have much game\n [doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts\n [patient] on the inside\n [doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything\n [patient] i had ice and an ace wrap\n [doctor] you had ice and what\n [patient] an ace wrap\n [doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly\n [patient] seven\n [doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct\n [patient] correct\n [doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home\n [patient] every morning\n [doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this\n [patient] i did not no\n [doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today\n [patient] some exercises ice and motrin\n [doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal\n [patient] yes it hurts\n [doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me\n [patient] when can i play basketball again\n [doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball\n [patient] i just pay at the y for fun\n [doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment\n [patient] yeah they do\n [doctor] okay i you know i'm i'm just thinking you know i need to get some new shoes for some of it my activities i love the i wish i could play basketball but i do a lot of bike riding so

we will make an appointment for seven days and we will go from there any questions\n [patient] i think you've answered them all thank you\n [doctor] okay great",

ten days ago with just some mild discomfort in on my right side and it seems to be getting worse over the last couple of days especially\n [doctor] okay and how bad would you say the pain is like it's a zero to ten on a scale today\n [patient] yeah it it waxes and wanes in severity it it's in general probably around a four or a five but sometimes it gets up as high as a seven or eight\n [doctor] okay is there anything that you notice that makes that pain worse or better like rest or movement or eating or anything else\n [patient] it's usually a little worse after a meal\n [doctor] hmmm okay\n [patient] in the morning before i've eaten it's it's not too bad but during the day after a meal it gets worse\n [doctor] okay alright and do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere\n [patient] it's pretty low it might radiate a little bit to the left but otherwise it's pretty localized to the right side\n [doctor] okay and have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the pain\n [patient] i've had some nausea and a little bit of heartburn but no vomiting\n [doctor] okay and and this is this is this is worse with you said worse worse with meals and is there anything else anything else that that makes it worse\n [patient] it is a little tender if i if i press on it and certain positions seem to make it a little worse when i'm most when it's the highest\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] pain\n [doctor] okay sure any pain with urination or any blood in your urine\n [patient] no no urinary symptoms\n [doctor] okay and how about any diarrhea and any of that or blood in your stool no\n [patient] no change in bowels\n [doctor] okay alright and so would you say that your appetite has been normal or decreased or any different\n [patient] well since i'm a little nauseated i'm not quite as hungry and i feel just kind of a little overall a little more fatigued over the last week\n [doctor] okay okay you did n't overeat you know during the super bowl last weekend did you that was i know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine\n [patient] well once the packers are out of the playoffs i do n't watch the super bowl so nothing i have n't eaten anything unusual\n [doctor] okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently\n [patient] not recently just back to wisconsin but no unusual travel or other exposures\n [doctor] okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently\n [patient] i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] so\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] it's it's been it they've been pretty rare\n [doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been\n [patient] i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week\n [doctor] hmmm\n [patient] and they're pretty good the upper number is usually around in the one twenties or low one thirties and the lower number usually in the seventies\n [doctor] okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that\n [patient] yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great\n [doctor] sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct\n [patient] correct\n [doctor] okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na order a cbc chem twelve urinalysis a pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound and so we will we will get those tests done right away i'm gon na keep you here we'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those and if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will i do n't want you to eat anything right now okay in case we find something that might require surgery alright unlikely but it's possible and then okay you know karen i meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain\n [patient] i've had some chills but no documented fevers\n [doctor] okay alright alright good yeah i i see you do n't have a fever today so that's that's good and so alright now for your second problem the migraine headaches you you do have a history of chronic migraines and and you have occasional bouts of of migraines nothing recent so let's continue the excedrin as needed over the counter for treatment there and then also the sumatriptan as needed for breakthrough migraine pain and i i would just encourage you to continue to avoid alcohol binges and caffeine binges and try to get enough sleep and all of that's easier said than done i know so but but that seems to be helping you now for your third problem of hypertension your blood pressure seems to be under adequate control so that's good we'll continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams per day and i will write you a refill prescription for that and send that to the pharmacy please continue to check your blood pressures daily so karen how does that all sound for a plan any other questions for me\n [patient] i actually do need a refill on my sumatriptan as well\n [doctor] okay alright sure yeah no problem so for your migraines the migraine problem i'm also gon na write you that that refill prescription for sumatriptan and anything else you can think of\n [patient] no the plan sounds good\n [doctor] alright sounds good we'll see you back in about four weeks or so and actually i am gon na follow up on your results today before i let you go but i'll check on those and and we'll we'll see

some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today\n[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding\n[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me\n[patient] yeah that's a mouthful\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here\n[doctor] i'll do this\n[patient] i i think i would break that\n[doctor] yeah i just saw that\n[patient] if you can do that\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up\n[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me\n[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections\n[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual\n[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections\n[doctor] diarrhea no\n[patient] frequently\n[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of\n[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies\n[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy\n[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions\n[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes\n[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street\n[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes\n[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that\n[doctor] i know i know\n[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away\n[doctor] right\n[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products\n[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally\n[patient] okay where did you go\n[doctor] i was in zambia\n[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful\n[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time\n[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial\n[doctor] no\n[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you\n[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried\n[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea\n[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and\n[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency\n[doctor] why is that\n[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency\n[doctor] okay okay thank you\n[patient] you're welcome\n[doctor] okay",

about that now i know that you have a history of coronary disease you know you had had a heart attack back in twenty eighteen we put that stent in your right coronary artery i know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low you know that what we call that ejection fraction was about thirty five percent have you been watching your salt intake\n [patient] yeah but you know it's been

has not done that so far this time\n [doctor] okay alright now tell me a little bit about when was the last time you saw your nephrologist\n [patient] about about a month ago\n [doctor] okay because as you know you know we we do talk about the fact that you have some kidney dysfunction about stage three so it's gon na be important for you to continue to follow up with your kidney doctor now are you how are you doing staying away from things like motrin and advil i know that you had had some knee pain in the past and you know how are you doing staying away from those medications\n [patient] yeah everybody has told me not to use it so i do n't except when i have pretty bad pain i had an episode about a week ago some pain in my feet actually and i i had to take motrin to get rid of it so yeah i took motrin for a while and i stopped as quickly as i could\n [doctor] okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it\n [patient] yeah tylenol's lovely it just is not very effective\n [doctor] okay alright yeah because i think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories because that can make your kidney function worse and obviously you know we do n't wan na see you go on dialysis or anything like that so we'll have\n [patient] mean neither\n [doctor] right so we'll have to you know really work on that now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet\n [patient] nobody's really talked to me about that so\n [doctor] okay yeah so you want\n [patient] i did n't know what high potassium foods are\n [doctor] okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know\n [patient] something to eat\n [doctor] what's that\n [patient] is there anything left is there anything left over that i ca n't eat\n [doctor] so yeah you can eat you know how about this how about we give you a a referral to a dietitian and they can help you with that\n [patient] sounds good\n [doctor] now are you watching the nba playoff should i or should i not bring that up i is that a sensitive subject i mean i'm a self expand and and we did sweep the nuts so\n [patient] yeah well i mean that's fan and i could n't sleep last night but you know\n [doctor] okay well maybe we should n't talk about\n [patient] kinda used to it you know where they where the favorite to win and then like that\n [doctor] yeah i know i i i will say i think jason tatum and jaylen brown paid played phenomenally so i do think that they help with the cell fix over the edge so but that's all we'll talk about that what's that\n [patient] i said yeah too bad they did\n [doctor] yeah alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you okay so you know looking at your vital signs here in the office you know your your blood pressure is about one thirty five over eighty so it's it's not too bad and maybe like to see it a little bit lower i'm just gon na be calling out my physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so on your neck exam i appreciate some jugular venous distention up to about nine centimeters there are no carotid bruits on your lung exam i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on your heart exam i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally so frank what does that mean all that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're retaining fluid now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that okay so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you okay so for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath i do believe you're having a an acute heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix from forty milligrams a day to eighty milligrams a day and i want you to call me in two days and let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now if you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that i want you to yeah call me we may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics okay i also wan na go ahead and just obtain\n [patient] salt on lasix all at once am i take it all at once or do i divide it up\n [doctor] how about you start taking the the increased dose in the morning and then we'll see how you do and if necessary i'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around four o'clock in the afternoon i do n't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay\n [patient] that sounds correct\n [doctor] so i also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease you know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that i hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and i'm gon na go ahead and call doctor white and let them know that i want you to be seen by them okay okay and then for your third problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i want you to go ahead and try to you know do n't please do n't take anymore motrin or advil i do want you to try to stick with tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with with some pain i want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies okay i will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay\n [patient] that sounds good do you have any idea what was going on with my foot pain before\n [doctor] well how long have you been having it how long you've been having that foot pain\n [patient] that's why i took the motrin it lasted you know four five days slowly went away\n [doctor] it was in both of your feet\n [patient] one\n [doctor] one and where in your foot was was it\n [patient] just in front of the big toe\n [doctor] just in front of the big toe okay have you ever had a history of gout\n [patient] nobody has told me about that\n [doctor] okay alright well it sounds like it could've been gout you know with your chronic kidneys chronic kidney disease it it's a possibility so for this possible gout flare for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare let's go ahead i wan na just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see and it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that would n't hurt it that would n't injure it any further and i think it would work just the same\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] okay any other questions\n [patient] just as long as you think i'm gon na get better\n [doctor] i think you're gon na get better yes i think we're gon na you know i really want you to watch your salt intake and i'm gon na go ahead and order that dietary dietitian referral so that you can get your diet under control but you really have to watch your salt intake i think that that's kind of what this heart failure exacerbation is about maybe a little dietary indiscretion\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] okay anything else\n [patient] yeah no that's good thank you\n [doctor] okay you're welcome bye",

Acute heart failure exacerbation.\n - Medical Reasoning: The patientâ€™s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.\n - Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.\n - Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.\n \n 2. Coronary artery disease.\n - Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.\n - Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.\n - Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam. I am going to call Dr. White and let them know that I want him to be seen by them.\n \n 3. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.\n - Medical Reasoning: This appears to be stable.\n - Patient Education and Counseling: I reminded the patient it is important to routinely follow up with his nephrologist. I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.\n - Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.\n \n 4. Possible gout flare.\n - Medical Reasoning: The patientâ€™s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.\n - Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.\n - Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.\n \n Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n I want him to call me in 2 days and let me know how his weight has been with increasing the diuretic. If he starts to have worsening shortness of breath in the next 2 days, I recommend he call me as we may have to admit him to the hospital for intravenous diuretics.",

better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing\n [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms\n [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since\n [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems\n [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department\n [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now\n [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work\n [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or\n [patient] yes yes that's the name of it\n [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that\n [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well\n [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help\n [patient] it does\n [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs\n [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs\n [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep\n [patient] yeah for the most part\n [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er\n [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then\n [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those\n [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone\n [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing\n [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days\n [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation\n [patient] probably about a month ago\n [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that\n [patient] no not really\n [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center\n [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again\n [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis\n [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana\n [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all\n [patient] hmmm hmmm\n [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that\n [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] so i do n't try to go there often\n [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] now i reviewed your vitals for today and your your blood pressure is good it's one twenty eight over eighty two your respiratory rate is sixteen and your oxygen saturation is ninety nine percent on room air which is a good thing i'm gon na take a listen to your heart here your heart is regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any ectopic beats or and i do n't hear anything like rubs murmurs or gallops which is good so i'm gon na go take and listen to your lungs here on your lung exam i do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze and that's bilaterally so i hear that on both sides i'm gon na go do a quick neck exam here neck is supple trachea is midline i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy taking a listen here i do n't appreciate any carotid bruit now i'm also gon na take a look at your hands here i note strong bilateral pulses i do n't appreciate any clubbing on any of your fingertips which is which is important and i also note brisk capillary refill i'm gon na go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that i had you do when you came into the office today and reviewing those results i do see that they are consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma so lem me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so now for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or i'm sorry moderate moderate intermittent asthma and it's gon na be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler so i'm gon na need you to take that as prescribed and that's really gon na help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently so the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler the less you will use your albuterol now it's not a fast acting inhaler like your albuterol but what is important is as going to be what helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation so if you're having an acute issue with your breathing i do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs and then i want you to wait and see how your breathing is before you would take an additional one to two puffs we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations as you continue to use your inhaled steroid i'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you and that's gon na help us look at your symptoms see where your your pain points can be you know like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing and we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan so do you have any questions comments or concerns otherwise i will see you in thirty days\n [patient] alright thank you\n [doctor] you're welcome\n [doctor] so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma i'm gon na start you on flovent one hundred ten micrograms one puff twice per day that's gon na be important for you to be consistent with your inhaled steroid inhaler this is gon na help prevent those daily symptoms and from needing for you to use your albuterol inhaler or that rescue inhaler less frequently you can continue using your ventolin inhaler and that would be two puffs every four to six hours p.r.n . i'm also gon na put together an asthma action plan for you so we know what to do based on your symptoms i'd like to see you again in a month or sooner if you have any worsening symptoms does that sound okay\n [patient] it does thank you\n [doctor] you're welcome i'll see you in a month\n [patient] alright thanks",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] alright\n [patient] good morning Julie how are you doing today\n [doctor] i'm doing okay i'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches\n [patient] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here\n [doctor] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe\n [patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on\n [doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation\n [patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse\n [doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising\n [patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the\n [doctor] in my on the side of my vision\n [patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face\n [doctor] no i have n't\n [patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running\n [doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics\n [patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike\n [doctor] hmmm\n [patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise\n [doctor] it is\n [patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri\n [doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri\n [patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here\n [doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal\n [doctor] okay go ahead sorry\n [patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me\n [doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery\n [patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment\n [doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week\n [patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri\n [doctor] okay alright thank you bye\n [patient] bye sorry",

Initially, her headaches appeared during menses, however she now experiences them more frequently and with more severity. Her pain is aggravated by physical activities. The patient states that she has been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, however she is unable to exercise for prolonged periods of time secondary to the headaches. The patient locates her pain to the right side of her head and behind her eye. She describes her pain as a pulsing sensation. She also reports intermittent ringing in her ears for the last few months. Additionally, she reports intermittent blurred vision on the lateral aspect of her vision. She denies any numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face.\n \n The patient enjoys running and wears either New Balance or Asics shoes.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Neurological: Reports headaches.

Once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion, I will also perform a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain. I have also advised her to be seen by a neuro ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. Questions were invited and answered today. The patient agrees to the treatment plan.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further recommendations.",

when i saw from the hospital your ejection fraction that's the pumping function of your heart was at about fifty percent which is you know low normal but not bad so that's good so okay just i would just watch your salt intake okay\n [patient] okay yeah i've been eating a lot of vegetables and and chicken without salt on it\n [doctor] okay great and then you know i i'm i'm glad that you're taking it easy now remind me this might cause you some anxiety were the denver denver nuggets swept or did they end up winning are they still in the nba playoffs i forget i know that you are a denver nuggets fan\n [patient] i am yeah they they are not sweep they were down three games but they wanted the last one so there is a there is a chance for it come back but they they play again tomorrow\n [doctor] okay yeah i'm a self expand and and we just swept the brooklyn net so i was really excited about that\n [patient] congrats that that's that's always good to sweep the nuts no one no one likes them\n [doctor] no one likes them okay well let's i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your blood pressure here in the office your blood pressure looks good it's about one twenty seven over sixty which is pretty good on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention there is no carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally and on your musculoskeletal exam your right radial artery cardiac cath site is clean dry and intact there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse now what does that mean betty so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack but i looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild mitral regurgitation which is just you know a little floppy valve which is is fine we'll just keep an eye on that and then everything else for the most part looks good so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction i wan na go ahead and continue with your aspirin continue on your brilinta you're gon na stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin you're gon na take lifelong until i tell you to okay i wan na go ahead and have you continue on the crestor forty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months okay do you have any questions about that\n [patient] yeah do you think i can no that sounds good i have one other more question though\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] do you think that i can swim again i miss swimming\n [doctor] yeah so at this point you're you know you're out like two weeks and your and your cath site is looks good so you can go ahead and and resume swimming now with that being said i would want you to just do a few laps here and there i do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's gon na give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab does that sounds like something that you can do\n [patient] yeah i think i have to\n [doctor] okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] okay any questions\n [patient] no i think that's it thank you very much\n [doctor] okay take care bye",

tylenol and ibuprofen but as soon as those wear off it it comes right back so they do n't really help\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i did try a little ice i probably should ice it more but i did n't

i know you're a golfer\n [doctor] yeah yeah yeah i do n't get out as often as i as as i like to but but the masters yeah that was that was amazing that was lot of fun to lot of fun did you catch it too\n [patient] i did\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] but that's it was i i could n't believe tiger went out there of course he did\n [doctor] right\n [patient] it was cool to see nothing\n [doctor] yep yep agreed agreed and so well listen we'll we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they\n [patient] they are like one fifty one sixty you know we just had easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies so i keep eating that\n [doctor] hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that\n [patient] yes twice a day\n [doctor] okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed\n [patient] yeah knock on wood i my asthma is pretty much under control\n [doctor] okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct\n [patient] that's correct yes\n [doctor] okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct\n [patient] yes that's right\n [doctor] okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you\n [patient] kills\n [doctor] okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you\n [patient] yeah it hurts a little bit\n [doctor] okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever\n [patient] no i do n't think so\n [doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me\n [patient] it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it\n [doctor] yeah yeah well\n [patient] i'm not i'm not young anymore\n [doctor] yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime\n [patient] okay",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on\n [patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] started having pain on my left back\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain\n [doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go\n [patient] it's constant\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable\n [doctor] alright are you able to urinate\n [patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood\n [doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes\n [patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time\n [doctor] third time alright\n [patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time\n [doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever\n [patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous\n [doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain\n [patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working\n [doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved\n [patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah\n [doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] so we are getting close there\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff\n [patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff\n [doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running\n [patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the\n [doctor] the one eighties which was really high\n [patient] right\n [doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that\n [patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] like\n [doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help\n [patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright\n [doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday\n [patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds\n [doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday\n [patient] i do\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i do take it\n [doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain\n [patient] no chest pain\n [doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain\n [patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain\n [doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tenderness on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound\n [patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you\n [doctor] okay no problem",

about your diet how's been thing as far as salty foods\n [patient] i've been trying to stay away from the salty foods but sugar intake i'm having a little bit of trouble with that\n [doctor] okay okay but it seems like you've been making good progress and that could be difficult sometimes and you mentioned being around i think you said your sister a few days ago or a family member\n [patient] yeah she was just kinda sick with similar symptoms and i noticed i started to developed a little bit of a cough right after\n [doctor] after that okay and how is your family doing how is everyone doing other than that other than being sick for your sister how is everyone going\n [patient] everyone's doing great\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] working busy with life yeah\n [doctor] okay and for you too were you on vacation last week and a lot of people had vacation last week\n [patient] yes i was on vacation last week actually\n [doctor] okay hopefully you were n't sick for too much of it\n [patient] no i was feeling okay\n [doctor] okay okay\n [patient] got back and started feeling poorly\n [doctor] sorry about that alright so what i'm gon na do now is i'm gon na go ahead and start your physical exam i looking at your vitals vitals look overall pretty good i do see your blood pressure is elevated at here it's one forty four over seventy two otherwise everything else looks good so let's check you out so first starting i'm just gon na check start with your sinuses and when i press here do you have any pain any tenderness when i do that\n [patient] no\n [doctor] no okay so no frontal sinus tenderness how about when i press on the on your cheeks here\n [patient] maybe a little bit just a little bit\n [doctor] on both sides\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay so bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness alright and i'm just gon na take a look at in your mouth if you can open up okay so i do see some do have some erythema of the pharynx and the tonsils are symmetrical i do n't appreciate any exudates now i'm just checking your neck and i do appreciate some anterior cervical adenopathy alright and i'm just gon na take a listen to you alright so listening to your heart so you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and you do still have that two out of six systolic ejection murmur at the left base now i'm taking listen to your lungs and on your lungs exam okay your lungs are nice and clear i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales or rhonchi alright and just looking at your lower extremities i do n't appreciate any edema there so let's talk about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of the cough so looking at your cough it does seem like you have a upper respiratory infection and so basically that's a virus most likely it's a virus that's causing your symptoms especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you so i want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run it's course and taking things just to help with your symptoms so drinking lots of fluids that's gon na help you trying i know you've been doing a cough medicine you can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood pressure and diabetes so you can try like a coricidin hbp can help with the cough and lots of rest okay lots of rest now we are in a current pandemic and so something i can check for you if you're okay with that is checking for covid if that's okay with you\n [patient] yes i'm okay with that\n [doctor] okay so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that and then we will give you those results okay any questions about that\n [patient] no questions\n [doctor] no okay so for problem number two the type two diabetes so we'll continue you on your metformin five hundred milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit so you'll be due at your next visit for your hemoglobin a1c and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells so we do that about every three months so at your next visit we'll check that for you and then we will go from there but it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three your high blood pressure so your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well you're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide so what i would like to do is increase it to twenty five milligrams once a day again i would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then i would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day so we can continue to see how you do with that okay\n [patient] okay alright that sounds\n [doctor] alright any questions for me\n [patient] no questions\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] thank you\n [doctor] thank you alright so at this point now i'm just gon na press the\n [doctor] i'm gon na",

left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so\n [doctor] how you doing is it is it gotten any better\n [patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started\n [doctor] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit\n [patient] hmmm\n [doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of\n [patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that\n [doctor] no nothing at all\n [patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that\n [doctor] no\n [patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before\n [doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help\n [patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck\n [doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain\n [patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder\n [doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere\n [patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go\n [doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well\n [patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it\n [doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all\n [patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers\n [doctor] no numbness or tingling\n [patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] acromioclavicular joints\n [doctor] yeah yeah\n [patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch\n [doctor] yes thank you yep\n [patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are\n [doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder\n [patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before\n [doctor] i have n't\n [patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan\n [doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away\n [patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days\n [doctor] okay alright thank you\n [patient] bye\n [doctor] okay bye",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Left shoulder pain.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Alan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.\n \n The patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.\n \n VITALS\n \n All vital signs are within the normal limits.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.\n \n RESULTS\n \n X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Left shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.",

pretty regularly\n[patient] i try to\n[doctor] okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or\n[patient] yeah it's definitely running below that\n[doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below\n[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty\n[doctor] good\n[patient] pretty regular\n[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press\n[patient] it's a little bit sore\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all\n[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel\n[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day\n[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so\n[doctor] do you have any questions about that\n[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just\n[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this\n[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing\n[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound\n[patient] that's fine\n[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound\n[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues\n[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable\n[patient] okay that'd be good\n[doctor] okay anything else\n[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave\n[doctor] well you know where to find me okay\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] take care bye",

percocet\n [doctor] okay well that's good i'm very glad to see that you were able to pass that stone have you seen a urologist before about this\n [patient] i have n't seen one in a while but yes i saw someone maybe a year ago\n [doctor] okay so yeah i know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones so i definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also wan na do some labs as well\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc\n [patient] hmmm\n [doctor] now have you been taking that regularly\n [patient] i have but at home my blood pressure is always great\n [doctor] okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control\n [patient] yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know\n [doctor] okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out\n [patient] yeah i do n't know i do n't know if i can make another appointment i just add to the extra\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] less time to make food so\n [doctor] yeah yeah definitely understand\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well\n [patient] yeah i take my metformin\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] so what have your blood sugars been running daily\n [patient] well i do n't check it very often\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] but i think they've been pretty good\n [doctor] okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright any any belly pain\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright so i'm gon na listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and we already knew about that previously so it has n't gotten any worse so that's good so i'm gon na just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones does that hurt\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright i'm gon na press here on your back\n [patient] no pain\n [doctor] okay so on your abdomen exam of your abdomen i'm showing no tenderness to palpation of the abdomen or tenderness of the the cva either on the right side so that that's good i think that's pretty much cleared up so let's we'll talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you and so my assessment you you did have the those kidney stones but i i think they are passed this time but i do want to get a couple of labs so we'll get a urinalysis\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control\n [patient] can i see doctor harris\n [doctor] of course yeah we can we can get you that road to doctor harris and\n [patient] he's not like\n [doctor] he's great he's he's he he he's great i've heard he does really good work so that'll be good so for the hypertension you seem to be doing well on the two . five of norvasc so we are not gon na make any changes to that do you need any refills right now\n [patient] no usually the pharmacy just sends them through when i call\n [doctor] okay great so we we wo n't we gave you refills with that i do wan na give you a consult to nutrition\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] just to help you with that diet\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] because i think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications\n [patient] hmmm\n [doctor] and then for your diabetes i'm just keep you on that on that five hundred of metformin okay i think you're doing well with that as well also but i do want you to start taking your blood sugars if you can take them before every meal\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] just to gauge where you are so you can tell how much food you should actually be be eating\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] i can try that\n [doctor] so how does that that sound\n [patient] that sounds like a plan when should i come back and see you\n [doctor] so you can you can come back in three months and we'll check up again i forgot you did tell me last time that you were having some issues with insomnia\n [patient] hmmm\n [doctor] how is that going for you is it still happening\n [patient] i mean sometimes i stay awake just kinda worrying about things but but i've tried some meditation apps and that helps\n [doctor] okay alright and i know we talked a little bit before about practicing proper sleep hygiene you know just making sure that all of your electronics are off you know dark room\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] cool room have you been doing that\n [patient] well i do like to sleep with the tv on and my phone is right by my bed because i never know if someone's gon na call me you know\n [doctor] yeah i i know i'm like apple i do n't know if you have an iphone or not but i know apple has this the the sleep mode now do that disturbance so you put that on\n [patient] it's a good idea\n [doctor] interrupt you\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay have you tried taking melatonin to sleep\n [patient] i used it a couple times but but it did n't seem to help that much\n [doctor] okay how about i do n't think i've prescribed you anything yet do you think you would need anything\n [patient] hmmm i do n't really wan na take any sleeping pills\n [doctor] okay that's understandable alright so for the last issue for the insomnia i'm just gon na have you take ten milligrams of melatonin as needed\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] and just try i guess the best as possible to practice the proper sleep hygiene so you can get to sleep at night and and feel pretty rested\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] so do you have anything any other questions for me\n [patient] no that's all\n [doctor] alright so we will see you in three months\n [patient] okay sounds good\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] like",

you feel the urge to move your face\n [patient] sometimes and then it moves and then i feel better\n [doctor] okay okay and so so dad how often are you seeing the twitch on karen\n [patient] i do n't know i mean it varies sometimes i see it several times an hour and there is other days we do n't see it at all until sometimes late afternoon but we definitely notice it you know everyday for the last several weeks\n [doctor] okay so karen how is how is how is soccer\n [patient] i like soccer\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] yeah dad dad takes me to play every saturday\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] it's it's pretty fun but there's this girl named isabella she she plays rough\n [doctor] does she\n [patient] she yeah she tries to kick me and she pulls my hair and\n [doctor] oh\n [patient] sometimes she's not very nice\n [doctor] that is n't very nice you gon na have to show her that that's not very nice you're gon na have to teach her a lesson\n [patient] yeah and and then sometimes after soccer we we go and i get mcdugge's and it and it's it makes for a nice day with dad\n [doctor] is that your favorite at mcdonald's in the the mcnuggates\n [patient] not not really but they are cheap so\n [doctor] okay alright well you you made dad happy at least right\n [patient] yeah that's what he says because i'm expensive because i want dresses and dogs and stuff all the time\n [doctor] yeah well yeah who does n't well okay well hopefully we will get you you know squared away here so you can you know play your soccer and go shopping for dresses with dad so so dad tell me does the karen seem bothered or any other and have any other issues when this happens\n [patient] no i mean when it happens she just continues playing or doing whatever she was doing when it happens\n [doctor] okay alright has she has she otherwise been feeling okay since this started has she been acting normally\n [patient] i i'd say she seems fine i mean she has been eating well and playing with her friends and she goes about her normal activities really\n [doctor] okay good\n [patient] never even though anything was going on\n [doctor] okay alright good so has has karen had any seizures in the past\n [patient] no\n [doctor] no okay and then so tell me when the twitch occurs do you ever notice any you know parts of her like moving or twitching\n [patient] well no uh it's just her face\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i mean the whole side of her face moves when it happens it seems like it several seconds and then it finally stops and she just seems to be blinking frequently and and and you know wait a minute i i did make a video so you can see just in case it does n't do it during the visit\n [doctor] okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome\n [patient] well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing\n [doctor] yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger\n [patient] really i had nobody in our family got anything like that\n [doctor] okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay coughing headache\n [patient] ma'am\n [doctor] okay how about any problems with karen's sleep\n [patient] nope\n [doctor] okay okay good let's go ahead and do physical exam on karen here alright karen i'm just gon na take a look at you and and ask you to follow some commands okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright can you follow my finger with your eyes good now can you do me a favor walk across the room for me great job okay now i want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now keep your eyes closed can you feel me touch you here how about okay how about there\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] does that feel the same\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay alright so i'm just gon na check your reflexes okay alright now on your on the neurological exam the patient is awake alert and oriented times three speech is clear and fluent gait is steady heel toe walking is normal and the cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen\n [patient] that's great\n [doctor] good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me\n [patient] so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing\n [doctor] yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards\n [patient] so you're not recommending any kind of treatment there is no pill or cream or nothing\n [doctor] not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall and the tic has n't impacted her school or her activities but if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay\n [patient] alright alright sounds good\n [doctor] alright thank you you guys have a good day\n [patient] doctor\n [doctor] bye karen",

We also discussed that they typically occur around 5 to 10 years of age and mostly resolve on their own within a year. Dad was advised that treatment is not recommended as they do not appear to be bothering Karen and she continues to do well in school and activities. Additionally, we discussed avoiding drawing attention to the tic as it may cause Karen to feel self-conscious and increase the severity of the tic.\n - Medical Treatment: None at this time.\n \n Patient Agreements: The patient's parent understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan. \n All questions were answered.",

quick russell your lungs are clear so good good and your extremities i do n't see any swelling or edema on your right radial artery the cath site there is clean and it's dry and intact and i do n't see any hematoma so that's good and there is a palpable rra pulse so russell i did review the results of your ekg which showed normal sinus rhythm good r wave progression and evolutionary changes

continue continue your lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i do n't think you need a diuretic at this time but i do want to add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and then you'll need to get labs next week okay and then we're gon na repeat another echocardiogram echocardiocardiogram in about two months\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] okay and then for your hypertension your third diagnosis of

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] hey good morning bobby how are you\n [patient] i'm doing okay i as you're aware doctor miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that i've had for several weeks they did he did an ultrasound and and said i had gallstones and they recommended i stay several way from some high fat food but i'm just still having a lot of pain and he referred me to you\n [doctor] alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel\n [patient] well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach\n [doctor] okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life\n [patient] when it's severe it's it's probably an eight\n [doctor] okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you\n [patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] you know i like to eat right\n [doctor] do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit\n [patient] well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and since then i've cut back on sugar and i started a little bit of a keto diet and i've lost about twenty five pounds over the last three months\n [doctor] okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well\n [patient] yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] but you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs\n [doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake\n [patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain\n [doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease\n [patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off\n [doctor] okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay and then i wan na talk a little bit about your activity level and your and and if you're exercising has this affected your ability to to get out and exercise\n [patient] not really i mean i usually i got ta watch it around meals you know but i've never been a big exerciser right after eating anyhow but you know i'm i'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out and you know i love photography i i love nature of photography and with the with the the woods going from you know that dark barron look to coming alive with that green and and butting i i love to get out and take foot photographs there\n [doctor] that's awesome to hear yeah i my wife and i like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rex center that just opened up have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago\n [patient] no i have n't been there i might have to try that out yeah\n [doctor] yeah it's awesome\n [patient] i like to get down near the river that's where i i like to catch especially around spring time\n [doctor] that's great yeah next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that'd be awesome to see\n [patient] okay cool\n [doctor] so i'm just curious talking about your symptoms here have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea but have you actually vomited from those symptoms\n [patient] there's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days i've had some what i i would describe as low grade fevers and yes you're right i have feel nauseated but i have n't thrown up\n [doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure was one twenty eight over eighty eight respiratory rate was sixteen your pulse rate was sixty eight you were afebrile today which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was ninety nine percent taking a listen to your heart here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no i do n't hear any ectopic beats no clicks rubs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs here they are clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation now i'm gon na go ahead and do an an abdominal exam i do note positive bowel sounds soft nondistended abdomen however you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant but i do n't note any rebound tenderness now i'm gon na press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side now take a breath in does that hurt when i press\n [doctor] so i i see that you're guarded there so i'm gon na say that that it did hurt when i it did hurt when i\n [patient] absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] sorry i was just trying to capture capture my breath\n [doctor] okay that's that's no problem so you are positive for murphy's signs but i do n't appreciate any peritoneal signs so let's talk a little bit about your results that i reviewed before you came in today so your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder and i do appreciate some mild thickening now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four . one millimeters now let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay i do believe you have some mild cholecystitis with gallstones i do n't appreciate any frank obstruction but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed and it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now since you have n't had any improvement with dietary modifications i am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder and i would like to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy now what that means is i'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's gon na remove that gallbladder through one of those little bitty incisions now the surgery is gon na take about an hour to an hour and a half and you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just wan na monitor you post procedure to make sure everything is okay you're still gon na wan na avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are gon na be high in fiber now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this\n [patient] no no questions today\n [doctor] okay now the other thing\n [patient] how soon can i how soon will i be able to get up and get moving back outside after the surgery\n [doctor] so the good news is since it's a laparoscopic procedure you're gon na be back on your feet pretty quick now for the first twenty four hours i'm gon na want you to take it pretty easy but after a couple of days if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you know we do n't want you hiking or anything like that but if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you can get up and walk around within a day or two and then in about a week or so i'll see you again and then we'll release you to go get back out there in nature\n [patient] okay thank you very much\n [doctor] you're very welcome the other thing i wan na talk briefly about is now your not your type two diabetes i want you to follow up with your physician just to make sure that you're handling your diabetes especially the fact that you're gon na have surgery and those type of things and we will just continue to monitor your diabetes as has been outlined by your your additional either your endocrinologist or your primary care provider i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get some paperwork signed and if you do n't have any questions for me i will see you next week and we will get this gallbladder out\n [patient] well thank you very much i'm looking forward to i i do n't want anymore of that pain so\n [doctor] alright that sounds good we'll see you next week then\n [patient] okay take care\n [doctor] yeah",

your ears\n [patient] i see\n [doctor] okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay and then once i get down here and around that low back i wan na press in the center first does that cause you a lot of pain\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] yeah okay\n [patient] yeah that that's the spot\n [doctor] okay and if i come over here to the

that up does that cause\n [patient] yeah yeah yeah that's that's\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] still get tender yeah\n [doctor] i can see that gritts on your face so okay that's good and you know as i look at your lower extremities there is no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet or anything like that\n [patient] hmmm no\n [doctor] okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me\n [patient] yeah can i still go to the bakery\n [doctor] i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that\n [patient] right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know\n [doctor] yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes\n [patient] right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know\n [doctor] not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain\n [patient] sounds good\n [doctor] okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door\n [patient] thank you\n [doctor] take care\n [patient] that one is a follow-up mm-hmm",

bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away\n [doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails\n [patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot\n [doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride\n [patient] absolutely i'd love it\n [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra\n [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now\n [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking\n [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping\n [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that\n [patient] no not at all\n [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies\n [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now\n [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that\n [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of\n [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process\n [patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared\n [doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes\n [patient] okay thank you",

I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.\n - Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline.

and how about any headaches or other neurologic symptoms like numbness or weakness or you know balance instability or anything like that\n [patient] little unsteady when i get the dizziness and a slight headache when the blood pressure numbers have been a little higher\n [doctor] okay and when you say dizzy are you feeling lightheaded like you might pass out or you feeling that the world spinning around you or what\n [patient] just a little fuzzy where you just feel more lightheaded\n [doctor] okay alright understood and you've not had any any fever or nausea vomiting anything like that have you or diarrhea\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay and are you feeling any palpitations or your heart racing anything unusual there\n [patient] not usually no\n [doctor] okay and are you still taking the lisinopril twenty milligrams once per day no actually i see we last visit we increased that to twice per day you're still taking that lisinopril twenty milligrams twice per day\n [patient] yes i am\n [doctor] okay you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance\n [patient] very rarely\n [doctor] okay great great you're still using that pill box that we suggested i think you had a pretty good system going there maybe maybe you're using that app now to take to keep track of one when to take your medicine are you doing that\n [patient] yes yeah i've i've used the pillbox and then tried the app it was a little confusing but i'm i'm pretty much on on track with staying on my medication schedule pretty accurately\n [doctor] that's great i think i think i remember you saying it was tricky to get that app set up but then your grandson helped you with it and those kids amazing what they can do these days right anything like that i always trust them my kids before me so hey by the way how did he do in his softball or in his in his little league tournament last month i think you said he had a big tournament coming up how did that go\n [patient] they they did great they they got all the way to the finals and then the team that the team that beat them was probably a little older a little bit more season but they had a great time\n [doctor] wow wow how fun that's fantastic well congrats good stuff alright well listen so so you're still taking your your lisinopril how about for your hyperlipidemia your your high cholesterol there are you still taking that atorvastatin\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still\n [patient] most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day\n [doctor] yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right\n [patient] correct\n [doctor] okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound\n [patient] i do n't think so anything that i need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things\n [doctor] yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me\n [patient] how much beer should i drink\n [doctor] probably not the best thing with you know with with with your high blood pressure fluctuating the way it is so not more than a couple drinks a week hate to tell you\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright okay great seeing you we'll see you back see you in a couple of weeks you take care",

    "originalNote": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Wayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.\n \n The patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.\n \n Regarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Constitutional: Denies fever and chills.\n Skin: Reports right foot wound.\n Neurological: Reports neuropathy.\n \n VITALS\n \n Temperature: 98.1.\n Heart rate: 72.\n Respiration: 16.\n Blood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n CV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.\n SKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.\n \n RESULTS\n \n 3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n 1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.\n 2. Diabetes.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.\n \n Regarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.",

you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today\n [patient] yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment\n [doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on\n [patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me\n [doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street\n [patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was\n [doctor] it was\n [patient] it was just phenomenal\n [doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon\n [patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for\n [doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day\n [patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped\n [doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis\n [patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it\n [doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me\n [patient] okay that's a bright light\n [doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection\n [patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye\n [doctor] well\n [patient] what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye\n [doctor] yeah literally yeah\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection\n [patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good\n [doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today\n [patient] okay okay\n [doctor] sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes\n [patient] okay thank you very much\n [doctor] thank you",

Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.\n \n SURGICAL HISTORY\n \n The patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.\n \n MEDICATIONS\n \n The patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.\n \n RESULTS\n \n X-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Low back pain, left side.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol.",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on\n [patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] i think it's been but lately\n [doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what\n [patient] it's gradually increasing for sure\n [doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea\n [patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off\n [doctor] hmmm\n [patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week\n [doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times\n [patient] a couple of times\n [doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] that's\n [patient] and the venti\n [doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking\n [patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup\n [doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it\n [patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen\n [doctor] hmmm okay\n [patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy\n [doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you\n [patient] no i have n't\n [doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it\n [patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so\n [doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct\n [patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so\n [doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing\n [patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease\n [doctor] yep okay\n [patient] i think that's a good decision though\n [doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions\n [patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food\n [doctor] hmmm\n [patient] lately that could be contributing towards my gastritis so i'm gon na cut back on that as well\n [doctor] okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime\n [patient] i will\n [doctor] alright you take care sure you got",

The onset of his symptoms began 2 years ago. He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets â€œmid-shortness of breathâ€ without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol. He denies any symptoms at this time including shortness of breath, rash, nausea, vomiting, and lip or throat swelling. The patient denies any previous issues with allergies.\n \n He enjoys hunting.\n \n VITALS\n \n Oxygen Saturation: Normal on room air.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n CONSTITUTIONAL: In no apparent distress.\n HEAD: No angioedema.\n RESPIRATORY: No audible stridor.

He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management. If we unable to determine his allergens, then we may consider further testing or immunotherapy.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up with me in 1 week for skin testing.",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft knee pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAndrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.\n\nThe patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.\n\nIn terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga.

[doctor] so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan\n [patient] yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away\n [doctor] i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do\n [patient] okay alright\n [doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks\n [patient] alright thank you\n [doctor] thank you",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Left shoulder pain.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Betty Rogers is a pleasant 50-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain.\n \n For the past few weeks, the patient has been experiencing constant pain isolated to the left shoulder. She denies any known injury or trauma; however, she is very active and is currently renovating her basement. She denies any associated numbness or tingling as well. While movements such as reaching and lifting exacerbate her pain, full flexion of the shoulder is the most severe. Her pain is also exacerbated if she lays on her shoulder, which subsequently causes sleep disturbance due to her being uncomfortable. She typically takes Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours, for aches and pains associated with her active lifestyle, and doing so reduces her shoulder pain to 2-3/10 on the pain scale. Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10.\n \n MEDICAL HISTORY\n \n The patient denies any previous trauma or injury to left shoulder.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n The patient reports that she has a very active lifestyle. She has also been renovating her basement recently.\n \n MEDICATIONS\n \n The patient reports that she has been taking Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain.\n Neurological: Denies left shoulder numbness or tingling.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n CV: Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds.\n NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left shoulder are intact to light touch.\n MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive range of motion. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip bilaterally.\n \n RESULTS\n \n X-ray imaging of the left shoulder was performed and reviewed in office today. These reveal no fracture or bony abnormality.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Left shoulder pain.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe this is most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. We discussed the nature of this condition in detail, and I have ordered an MRI for further evaluation. I'm going to put in a referral for 6 to 8 weeks of physical therapy, during which time she should continue with Tylenol as-needed. If her symptoms do not improve, we can consider administering a steroid injection.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",

night and so i just really got to feeling bad i called my friend diane and she said i probably ought to call nine one one since i was having a hard time talking and so i called nine one one and they sent out an ambulance and they took me into the er on the it was quite an experience\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] having an ambulance ride and and i've never done that before so not an experience i wan

n't do n't have quite as much shortness of breath i think maybe getting up and walking a little more is helping\n [doctor] and they gave you a water pill and is that is that helping is that making you pee a lot\n [patient] yeah yeah i have almost incontinence so\n [doctor] goodness\n [patient] yes that's not very pleasant at all\n [doctor] and so they added another blood pressure medication also how are you doing with that are you feeling a little bit better\n [patient] yeah i think so\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] if i can remember to take the pills\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] that seems to be a sticky point\n [doctor] well a a pill box or maybe setting an alarm on your phone might really help\n [patient] okay i'll i'll give that a try anything that will help\n [doctor] yeah okay well that's good to hear so now have you bought a blood pressure cuff to have at home now\n [patient] yes i already had one but i very failed if i ever used it\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] but\n [doctor] got it\n [patient] i'll i'll try to use it everyday now\n [doctor] okay and you might even just keep a log of what your blood pressures are and when it's up think about you know what you've eaten if you've done something different because that may help you to figure out what you need to cut back on or how you might need to change your your eating habits a little bit so\n [patient] okay okay\n [doctor] have you been short of breath or any problems sleeping since you've been home\n [patient] no i've been sleeping like a log\n [doctor] okay good alright have you had any chest pain\n [patient]

is ninety eight . seven and your heart rate is seventy two your respirations are eighteen your oxygen saturation looks pretty good at at ninety six percent okay now on your neck exam there is no jugular venous distention on your heart exam i appreciate a two over six systolic ejection murmur which i've heard before and so it's stable and your lungs are clear bilaterally and your lower extremities show just trace edema now now we since we did the echocardiogram i reviewed those results and it does show a preserved ef of fifty five percent abnormal diastolic filling and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem for your congestive heart failure it sounds like this was caused by dietary indiscretion and some uncontrolled hypertension so i want you to continue on your bumex two milligrams once daily continue to watch your diet and avoid salty foods might try keeping that log we talked about with your blood pressures and what you've eaten if if your blood pressure seems a little high also weigh yourself daily and call me if you gain three pounds in two days okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] and i also want you to see a nutritionist to give you some education about what foods you can eat okay now for your second problem for i know this sounds like this is just for you and so for your second problem for your hypertension i want you to continue on the cozaar one hundred milligrams daily continue on the norvasc five milligrams once daily also and i'm going to order a renal artery ultrasound just to be sure we're not missing anything and then like maybe you know some renal artery stenosis or something and so so for your third problem for your kidney disease i wan na get some more labs to make sure you tolerate this the new medications and then i'll see you again in three months do you have any questions\n [patient] no i do n't think so not today\n [doctor] alright

changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys\n [doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling\n [patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high\n [doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home\n [patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety\n [doctor] wow\n [patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again\n [doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home\n [patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one\n [doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all\n [patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore\n [doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so\n [patient] did they\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] that's good to know\n [doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally\n [patient] alright do you want the honest answer\n [doctor] well yeah that would be better\n [patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better\n [doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches\n [patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis\n [doctor] okay what about chest pain\n [patient] no chest pain\n [doctor] shortness of breath\n [patient] no shortness of breath\n [doctor] even with exertion\n [patient] even with exertion\n [doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed\n [patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no\n [doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure\n [patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease\n [doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on\n [patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on\n [doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve\n [patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday\n [doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for\n [patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends\n [doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me\n [patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control\n [doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan\n [patient] that sounds good thank you\n [doctor] okay take care i'll talk to you later\n [patient] okay alright bye",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Right ankle pain.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.\n \n The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.\n \n Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.\n \n MEDICAL HISTORY\n \n The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.\n \n MEDICATIONS\n \n The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.\n Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.\n \n VITALS\n \n Normal\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n GAIT: antalgic gait\n CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.\n NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.\n MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.\n \n RESULTS\n \n X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",

[doctor] okay and so this happened couple days ago or how many days ago\n [patient] two days ago\n [doctor] two days ago okay and so it's your left ankle and it kinda just twisted underneath you on the kind of on the inside\n [patient] yeah more on the it's more on the outside of my hips\n [doctor] and did you fall down or did you just kind of cut catch yourself\n [patient] no i fell\n [doctor] okay and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up\n [patient] i was but it was very sore and then started swelling and quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk\n [doctor] sure have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that\n [patient] ibuprofen some ice and elevation\n [doctor] okay has that helped much or not really\n [patient] a little bit\n [doctor] okay and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all\n [patient] no it's mostly just the outside of my ankle\n [doctor] okay got it and no bleeding or i'm sure it's a little swollen probably\n [patient] yeah it's swollen but no bleeding\n [doctor] well i'll have you take off your shoes in a second we'll examine you in a second but since you're here and i wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have n't i have n't seen you in a year so let's talk about your history of diabetes as well are you taking the metformin how's your blood sugars been how how're you managing that any issues with that\n [patient] no they've been pretty stable\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] so with my diet\n [doctor] good\n [patient] so\n [doctor] you're checking your sugars regularly as well\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay your hemoglobin a1c last time i looked at epic was about six . eight which is really good so i think you're doing a great job we had talked about you know cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising so it sounds like you're you're you're doing a pretty good job with that have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no\n [patient] i am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks\n [doctor] okay alright so we'll so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that\n [patient] i have an appointment\n [doctor] perfect excellent okay and how is your blood pressure been i know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good it's about one seventy over i'm sorry one twenty over seventy you're taking norvasc any issues with that any do you need any refills or anything\n [patient] i need a refill on that yes\n [doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you\n [patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] thank you\n [doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay\n [patient] thank you\n [doctor]

Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.\n \n He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.\n \n MEDICATIONS\n \n The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n CV: Pulses are equal in all extremities.\n NEURO: Sensation is normal to light touch distally.\n MSK: \n Examination of the right elbow: Limited range of motion with extension with pain.

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] so barbara i i know you are here for some itchy scalp pain can you tell me a little bit about how you're doing\n [patient] yeah it's still quite a problem you know something i've been suffering with for so long now it's still quite itchy and it's really embarrassing too because i'll have dandruff so much like all over me but but i just ca n't stop itching\n [doctor] okay when did you first notice this\n [patient] i wan na say it's been a while but probably worsening in the past like six months or so\n [doctor] okay okay and have you seen ever noticed any rashes either when it first started or intermittently anywhere else\n [patient] on my body no not really\n [doctor] okay okay just mainly up underneath your on your scalp there uh and i can i can see that man that looks really itchy and scaly have you died your hair recently or used any other chemicals you you know like a new hair spray or gel\n [patient] nothing new i mean i do dye my hair but i've been doing that for years now but otherwise i do n't really use a lot of products in my hair\n [doctor] yeah i you know it's funny you say that because i keep saying i earned this gray hair and i'm gon na keep it so yeah have you tried any over the counter treatments i know there is a lot out of there something you know like a t gel or any of those other have those helped\n [patient] yeah i did that i did head and shoulders i even tried some castor oil and but none of them really seemed to be helping\n [doctor] okay okay let's talk about some other symptoms any joint pain fever weight loss\n [patient] not that i can recall i've been pretty good otherwise\n [doctor] okay good and going back you know to your grandparents has anybody else in the family had similar symptoms that you're aware of\n [patient] no well maybe my sister\n [doctor] maybe your sister okay\n [patient] yeah maybe my sister i mean i know she'll is no one has as bad as i do but she does report like just having a dry scalp\n [doctor] okay okay now you know a lot of times we can see this with you know high levels of stress has there been any new mental or emotional stressors at work or at home\n [patient] not really i mean it's basically the same things\n [doctor] okay yeah i yeah we have a lot of that yes so let me go ahead and and look at this a little closer here the first off i wan na tell you the the vital signs that the my assistant took when you came in your blood pressure is one thirty over sixty eight your heart rate was ninety eight and your respiratory rate was eighteen so those all look good and appear normal and your temperature was ninety seven . seven and that is all normal now when i look at your scalp here i do notice that you have demarcated scaly erythematous plaques and that's just kind of explaining technically what's going on those patches and they're they're in a patchy format they're diffusely present across the back of your skull and that's probably why you you see all that that that white dander you know on your on your your clothes as you go through the day now lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan i think that you have a scalp psoriasis and let's and here is my thoughts on that what i would like you to use is to use clobetasol that's a zero . zero five percent solution and i want you to use that twice daily on the the affected areas of your scalp so you're just gon na put this on and just kinda gently rub it in now i know to do it twice daily is going to be difficult but if you can do it first thing in the morning when you get up and then before you go to bed you know get a shower and before you go to bed that will be great i want you to continue to use t-gel shampoo that you listed when you first came in that's a very good solution shampoo for that and that will help with controlling a lot of this now there is no cure for this unfortunately and flareups can be unpredictable but we see that you know not a we do n't have a great finger on what causes the flare ups but i'm gon na give you some steroids that will help and we're gon na have to manage that on a ongoing basis but when you get do get a flare up i want you to be using these flare steroid that i give you as we go through that and then i wan na see you back here in three months or sooner if it gets significantly worse do you have any questions for me\n [patient] no okay so i'll just use that steroid solution and then just as needed if it's really bad but then otherwise just use the t gel\n [doctor] yeah i want it's exactly what i want you to do i want you to use that that solution twice daily when you get that flare but then other than that just continue to use that t-gel shampoo\n [patient] alright\n [doctor] okay i'm gon na have my nurse come in and get you discharged but i the we will see you again in three months or and again please if it gets worse please do n't hesitate to call me and come in sooner\n [patient] alright perfect thank you\n [doctor] thank you\n [patient] okay bye",

[doctor] for your blood sugar check are you checking that or not really\n [patient] i i i did it a couple of weeks ago\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and it was about it i i think about two thirty it was okay\n [doctor] okay so your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . five and we had talked about you know trying to improve your diet we had talked about you know we wan na avoid going to insulin but it sounds like it's been a challenge to kinda control the diet and also your blood sugars have been running a little bit high\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay alright\n [patient] yeah it's it's been a challenge\n [doctor] alright and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that are you peeing a whole lot or anything like that no\n [patient] yeah i'm feeling like crazy\n [doctor] okay alright\n [patient] ca n't figure out why because i'm not drinking very much\n [doctor] alright and how is your back then has that been okay i know you're sitting you said you're sitting on the couch a lot watching tv but\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] besides that anything else\n [patient] yeah you know it it just it just really hurts so you know and so that's why i sit on the couch so much\n [doctor] okay alright no weakness or numbness in your legs right now\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] no\n [doctor] so let me examine you now gloria i'm gon na go ahead and do an exam and let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings just so i can record this and put it into my my into my chart so neck exam you do have a little bit of swelling in your neck little bit of jvd no bruits your lung exam you have some crackles in both bases and some rales that i can hear and there are a little bit of intermittent wheezing as well on your heart exam you have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past otherwise regular rate and rhythm it does n't feel a regular your belly exam your belly's slightly distended there's no tenderness or guarding or anything like that so that does n't that looks pretty good on your leg exam you do have some one plus pitting edema or actually almost one and a half plus pitting edema in your both of your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign that means no blood clots otherwise neurologic exam is normal the rest of your exam is normal so what does this all mean so let me explain that so for the first problem the shortness of breath you know i think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure what i'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from twenty milligrams to sixty milligrams for the next four days i'm gon na have you check your weights everyday and also i'm gon na go ahead and have you use your albuterol and atrovent we had given you some inhalers in the past i can give you another refill if you need to help with that some of the breathing that you're having the shortness of breath so i'd like to get some of this fluid off you have you check your weights daily we'll have you increase your dose of lasix we'll have you use a breathing treatments and see if that helps your shortness of breath i'd like to have you come back in about couple days actually i wan na see how you're doing and if it does n't get better we may have to increase the dose or send you to the hospital okay\n [patient] i do n't want to go to the hospital doctor\n [doctor] yeah so let's try to let's try to use the lasix and let's try to let's try to you know use the breathing treatments and and do that for the second problem the diabetes that we just talked about i like to go ahead and order another blood test another hemoglobin a1c i think we need to your blood sugars have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked your last one so i wan na check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days we should have the results back we can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of the you know add a different medication at that point but but right now i'm gon na order some blood tests we'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point okay\n [patient] so i had a piece of cake before i came in here is that gon na affect the the lab work\n [doctor] yeah we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar we'll we'll order the hemoglobin a1c that should n't be actually matter because that checks long term but if we need your blood sugar may be elevated today i i would n't be surprised alright and i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain i'm gon na go ahead and put you on some naprosyn and some flexeril which is a muscle relaxer i'm gon na give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch it'll also help your blood sugar and why do n't we have you if that does n't work the the pain medicine and the physical we can start physical therapy and see if that helps okay\n

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] good morning julie how are you doing this morning\n [patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you because of this this knee pain that i've been having for about six months now\n [doctor] okay and do you remember what caused the pain initially\n [patient] honestly i do n't i ca n't think of anytime if i fell or like i i've really been trying to think and i ca n't really think of any specific event\n [doctor] okay now it it says here that it's in both knees is that correct\n [patient] yes both my knees\n [doctor] okay it kinda try let's let's try describing the pain for me please\n [patient] yeah it's kind of feels like it's like right behind my kneecaps\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and it's like a deep achy pain\n [doctor] a deep achy pain okay what kind of activities makes the pain feel worse\n [patient] let's see so anytime so if i'm sitting at my desk and i get up i have a lot of pain so anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs\n [doctor] okay so you work from home\n [patient] i do\n [doctor] okay okay so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it i mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it\n [patient] no well first thing in the morning but otherwise it's downstairs\n [doctor] okay okay how do you like working from home\n [patient] you know it has it's plus and minuses\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i like it though my i like my commute\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] i love it\n [doctor] and the parking i'm sure the parking is\n [patient] and the parking is great\n [doctor] yeah i you know if i could do telehealth visits all day long i would be totally happy with that yeah and just set it home and do those so you mentioned is there anything that makes that pain feel better\n [patient] usually after like if i feel that pain and then i just it does get better\n [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past what have what are they and did they work at all\n [patient] yeah i've done some ibuprofen or aleve sometimes some tylenol and that does help\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] it takes the edge off\n [doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying\n [patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain\n [doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office\n [patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile\n [doctor] yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up\n [patient] exactly\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] it's\n [doctor] okay so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before\n [patient] you know despite how active i am i you know i've never\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] injured or broken a bone\n [doctor] okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me\n [patient] so will i be able to run again\n [doctor] absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else\n [patient] no i think that's it\n [doctor] okay have a great day\n [patient] okay you too\n [doctor] thank you\n [patient] bye",

you know try to you know monitor your diet and and your blood sugars are you taking the metformin\n [patient] yeah i think that's the big pill\n [doctor] okay i'm not really sure what it looks like but you're supposed to be taking a thousand milligrams twice a day are you taking it twice a day\n [patient] yeah i'm taking my wife puts in the my box i take something twice a day i know that\n [doctor] okay how is your wife doing she is a very lovely person i i i remember seeing her at your last visit\n [patient] she is doing fine\n [doctor] she\n [patient] as long as she stays on the other side of the house no\n [doctor] yeah i say the same thing to my husband okay well let's go ahead i wanted you to just do a quick physical exam so i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so looking here at your vital signs you know you do n't have a fever here in the office which is good your temperature is ninety eight . four on your blood pressure it seems like you are doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure your blood pressure is right where it should be it's about one twenty five over sixty two which is good your heart rate is nice and slow in the eighties and your oxygenation is fine it's ninety seven percent on room air so all of that is is really good now on on your facial exam i'm just pressing on your face here do you have any pain to palpation\n [patient] just right underneath my eyes\n [doctor] on one on what side\n [patient] actually both\n [doctor] okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here\n [patient] yep\n [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation on the right knee and i'm just gon na move it all around does that hurt\n [patient] little bit yeah\n [doctor] okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound\n [patient] that sounds good\n [doctor] okay so for your second problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have a a a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning and i really wan na just go ahead and and i'll prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area and i'm gon na go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did n't injure any bones although i do n't think you did but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray how does that sound\n [patient] okay that sounds like good good plan\n [doctor] okay and then for your third problem of your hypertension let's just continue on the lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and lastly your fourth problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c just to make sure we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin and i really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal how does that sound\n [patient] okay i'll try that i try my best\n [doctor] alright that sounds good i'll i'll be in touch with you with those results okay\n [patient] okay appreciate it\n [doctor] alright take care bye",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Right hand pain.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Alexis Gutierrez is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right hand pain.\n \n Approximately 6 months ago, the patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on her right hand. The numbness and tingling has become constant over the past month or so and is accompanied by pain with typing and using a mouse, which she does all day while working on a keyboard. She denies any sleep disturbance associated with her symptoms. Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n The patient reports that she works on a keyboard all day.\n \n MEDICATIONS\n \n The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Constitutional: Denies sleep disturbance.\n Musculoskeletal: Reports pain in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.\n Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n MSK: Examination of the right hand: Pain with flexion and extension of the wrist.. Decreased grip strength on the right compared to the left.

We discussed the nature of this condition, as well as her treatment options, in detail. I recommend we treat this conservatively with nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen, but I want to increase her dose to 600 mg 4 times daily. I'm also going to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study for further evaluation. If this is positive, we can consider additional treatment with physical therapy or surgical intervention with carpal tunnel release.",

foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened\n [patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot\n [doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before\n [patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot\n [doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing\n [patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field\n [doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then\n [patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well\n [doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n [patient] with ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three\n [doctor] okay and then without your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n [patient] like a seven eight\n [doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer\n [patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time\n [doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else\n [patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school\n [doctor] that's\n [patient] high school teams\n [doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation\n [patient] no i have not\n [doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of\n [patient] alright thank you\n [doctor] you're welcome",

signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower

tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem\n [patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking\n [doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing\n [patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down\n [doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that\n [patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids\n [doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that\n [patient] it's really just about solids\n [doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all\n [patient] not that i want\n [doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going\n [patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise\n [doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all\n [patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time\n [doctor] and how are the numbers looking\n [patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting\n [doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home\n [patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range\n [doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that\n [patient] no that sounds great\n [doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything\n [patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great\n [doctor] okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc we'll get that sent over to the pharmacy okay\n [patient] thank you\n [doctor] alright thanks good seeing you thanks for coming in to them",

what's going on with your with your chest pain\n [patient] i do n't know every time i start walking i'm just having this kind of pressure and chest pain in my chest\n [doctor] okay are you having it now or is it gone right now\n [patient] right now it's not there\n [doctor] okay and how long have you been having this\n [patient] probably maybe three months\n [doctor] okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it\n [patient] it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain\n [doctor] alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it\n [patient] i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure\n [doctor] okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now\n [patient] nothing right now\n [doctor] okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going\n [patient] yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose\n [doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you\n [patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting\n [doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that\n [patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure\n [doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years\n [patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain\n [doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so\n [patient] someone had told me before\n [doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay\n [patient] okay sounds good\n [doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that\n [patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill\n [doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not\n [patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away\n [doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea\n [patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication\n [doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright any other questions we got\n [patient] that's it\n [doctor] alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today\n [patient] thank you appreciate it",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Chest pain on exertion.\n \n MEDICAL HISTORY\n \n The patient has a medical history of diabetes type 2. She has not been formally diagnosed with hypertension, but her blood pressures have been trending high.\n \n FAMILY HISTORY\n \n Patient reports family history of heart disease.\n \n MEDICATIONS\n \n Patient reports taking metformin 500 mg twice daily.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Constitutional: Denies diaphoresis or clamminess.\n Cardiovascular: Reports chest pain.\n Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.\n Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n Neck\n - General Examination: No JVD, swelling, or carotid bruits.\n \n Respiratory\n - Assessment of Respiratory Effort:\n - Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Pulses are equal.\n \n Gastrointestinal\n - Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness. Soft, no guarding.\n \n Musculoskeletal\n - Examination: 1+ nonpitting edema in the ankles. No calf tenderness.\n \n RESULTS\n \n EKG was obtained and reviewed in office today and is unremarkable. Hemoglobin A1c: 7.0\n \n ASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n \n 1. Chest pain.\n - Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.\n - Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.\n - Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.\n \n 2. Type 2 diabetes.\n - Medical Reasoning: She appears to be doing well on her current regimen.\n - Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.\n - Medical Treatment: I'm going to put in an order for a repeat hemoglobin A1c to check for any needed medication adjustments and have her follow up in 2 weeks. In the meantime, I want her to continue with metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications.\n \n 3. Hypertension.\n - Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.\n - Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.\n - Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.\n \n Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",

me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient\n [patient] and i'm your patient yeah\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] i've been having pains let's just say for the last two weeks\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] it's it starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it it's under control but i have bouts where it kinda gets a little out of control\n [doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you\n [patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there\n [doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating\n [patient] not really\n [doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine\n [patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards\n [doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain\n [patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists\n [doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten\n [patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten\n [doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad\n [patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away\n [doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you\n [patient] i'm a horrible active by the way\n [doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that\n [patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines\n [doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past\n [patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past\n [doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they\n [patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of\n [doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right\n [patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well\n [doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass\n [patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out\n [doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend\n [patient] just getting this pain under control\n [doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt\n [patient] no no no pain\n [doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in\n [patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender\n [doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you\n [patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible\n [doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer\n [patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing\n [doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to\n [patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want\n [doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me\n [patient] no i'm friend\n [doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good\n [patient] perfect thank you\n [doctor] alright great",

He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain. Of note, the patient has a personal history of kidney stones, some which were passed independently, usually within a week, while others required surgical intervention or lithotripsy. He also has several family members with a histories of kidney stones.\n \n MEDICAL HISTORY\n \n The patient has a personal history of kidney stones treated conservatively, surgically, and with lithotripsy.\n \n FAMILY HISTORY\n \n The patient has a significant family history of kidney stones.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Constitutional: Reports chills.

I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively at this point. I advised him to continue drinking plenty of fluids so he can hopefully pass the stone. He has been controlling his pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen and should continue to do so. I also prescribed tramadol 50 mg for any breakthrough pain. His primary care physician provided him with a strainer and I advised him to continue using this as well. I want to order a BMP, a urinalysis, and a urine culture to rule out any need for antibiotics. We will have him follow up in 2 weeks for re-evaluation. If he has not passed the kidney stone at that time, we can consider proceeding with lithotripsy.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",

pain that you've had for a few weeks now\n [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away\n [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before\n [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so\n [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not\n [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it\n [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go\n [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain\n [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also\n [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] of course\n [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that\n [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it\n [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or\n [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit\n [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and\n [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift\n [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or\n [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of\n [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the right shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan\n [patient] no that sounds good\n [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay\n [patient] sounds great\n [doctor] okay thanks\n [patient] thanks\n [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or\n [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but\n [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that\n [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good",

off a curb\n [doctor] how long ago did that happen\n [patient] about two and a half weeks ago\n [doctor] two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you\n [patient] the right knee the outside of my right knee\n [doctor] the outside of your right knee\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or\n [patient] no i just sorta turned over my ankle\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk\n [doctor] and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk\n [patient] no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again\n [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain\n [patient] really nothing\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and\n [doctor] does the ibuprofen work\n [patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better\n [doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there\n [patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel\n [doctor] okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that\n [patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type\n [doctor] okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to\n [patient] no i ride the bike\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though\n [doctor] okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor\n [patient] i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides\n [doctor] okay what kind of rides do you like\n [patient] i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with\n [doctor] i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all\n [patient] yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear\n [doctor] okay when did you break your toe\n [patient] i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury\n [doctor] okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new\n [patient] right correct\n [doctor] alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee\n [patient] no not physically\n [doctor] okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt\n [patient] only when you pull it to the outside\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts\n [doctor] okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home\n [patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day\n [doctor] okay and so does that help at all\n [patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much\n [doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots\n [patient] and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse\n [doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] any questions about that\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything\n [patient] i will\n [doctor] okay bye\n [patient] bye",

to put like a little bit of weight on it but i'm i i'm still limping\n [doctor] okay well you know that's not good we'll we'll hopefully we can get you fixed up here so how much how much pain have you been in on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt\n [patient] it's it's more like so when i first fell it was pretty bad but now it's it's at like a six you know like it's uncomfortable\n [doctor] okay and how would you describe that pain is it a constant pain or is it only when you move the ankle\n [patient] it's it's constant it's like a throbbing pain you know and like when i touch it it feels kinda warm\n [doctor] okay alright yeah but yeah i can feel it here so it does feel a little bit warm so i said you've been in a little bit of pain so have you taken anything for it\n [patient] well like last night i iced it and i kept it elevated you know i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning\n [doctor] alright has the ibuprofen helped at all\n [patient] not really\n [doctor] okay alright so i just want to know i know some of my patients they have like bad ankles where they hurt the ankles all the time but have you ever injured this ankle before\n [patient] so you know in high school i used to play a lot of soccer but and and like i had other injuries but i've never injured like this particular ankle before but because i used to play like all the time i knew what i was supposed to do but this is i also knew that it was it was time to come in\n [doctor] okay yeah yeah definitely if you if you ca n't walk on it we definitely good thing that you came in today and we were able to see you so have you experienced any numbness in your foot at all\n [patient] no no numbness and i do n't think i've had like any tingling or anything like that\n [doctor] okay that that's good yeah it sounds like you have sensation there so yeah that that's really good so let me do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals your blood pressure was one twenty over eighty which is good your heart rate your spo2 was ninety eight percent which is good that means you're you're getting all of your oxygen and so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick so when i press here does that hurt\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] alright what about here\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is ecchymosis so you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral\n [patient] malleolus\n [doctor] malleolus associated with swelling there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue there is no laxity on the anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot there your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so we did get an x-ray of your ankle before you came in and luckily it's there is no fractures no bony abnormalities which is really good so let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your right ankle pain your symptoms your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain have you sprained your ankle before most times people do the athletics play soccer it happens every so often but have you done that before\n [patient] no i do n't think so\n [doctor] okay well you're one of the lucky ones some of my my patients that play sports they sprain their ankle seems like every other week so good for you so for that that that ankle sprain i just want to keep i want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and i want you to continue to ice it you can ice it let's say five times a day for twenty minutes at a time just to help that swelling go down i'm gon na give you an air cast to help you stabilize the ankle so keep it from moving and then i'll give you crutches and so i want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days and then you can start walking on it as tolerated tolerated so how does that sound\n [patient] it's alright\n [doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me\n [patient] yeah like how long do you think it's gon na take for me to heal\n [doctor] i mean it should take a a couple of days i mean i think in a day or two you will be able to walk on it but still think it will be sore for the next couple of weeks you know your ankle sprain seems to be not the worst but it's kinda you know medium grade ankle sprain so as i would say about two to three weeks you should be back to normal you will see some of that bruising go away\n [patient] yeah okay can i get a doctor's note\n [doctor] no because you need to go back to work because you work on the computer not running so\n [patient] fine\n [doctor] yeah you ca n't get a doctor's note so if you if i write a note i'm gon na tell your boss that you have to go to work\n [patient] okay thanks\n [doctor] so i i would n't do that but yeah but otherwise if if if you continue to have pain after this week if you feel like it's not getting better please feel free to contact the office and we can get you back in and possibly do an mri if we you know need to\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] alright\n [doctor] anything else\n [patient] no that's it\n [doctor] alright thanks",

[doctor] okay now i you mentioned that you had taken some ibuprofen for that pain now let's talk a little bit about your pain rating okay zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life can you rate your pain for me without any tylenol or advil or any nsaid can you rate your pain for me\n [patient] about a six\n [doctor] okay now when you take that medication can you rate

we've been down there we got some pain we we got went and got some samples and then hey while we were there we ended up deciding to put down a bunch of flooring too so i really recommend you guys if you get a chance go over there and take a look at their sales and and see if you ca n't finish your remodeled project\n [patient] that sounds great i'll have to take a look at the flooring as well\n [doctor] that sounds good so now just out of curiosity are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in in your arm or hand\n [patient] i did when i initially hurt it but i'm not no longer having any numbness or tingling\n [doctor] okay so a little bit about my physical exam i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you today now your vitals look good but specifically on your right shoulder exam you do have limited active and passive range of motion and there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips and on your neurovascular exam of your right arm you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality mkay so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now i your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy i think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder so that i think that's that's why you are having the that shoulder pain i do wan na order an mri of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy and that's gon na be about six to eight weeks now my patients are very successful with their pt and let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatment such as a steroid injection to that shoulder i do want you to continue to take an nsaid if you can tolerate tylenol i want you to go ahead and take tylenol for that pain do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan\n [patient] no i think it sounds good ca n't wait to to get some relief\n [doctor] okay so i know we ordered it for six to eight weeks but i wan na see you again in two weeks

left ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex and the ligament on the outside of your ankle is what got stretched when you fell now the best treatment for this sprain is what you've kind of already been doing doing the elevation and compression and ice so we're gon na continue the rice protocol and i am gon na go ahead and give you an air cast just to stabilize that ankle i'm gon na prescribe you some crutches i want you to stay off that leg but i do want you to start walking as tolerated but it may be a few days before you feel like

[doctor] okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin\n [patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day\n [doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything\n [patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams\n [doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here\n [patient] no\n [doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help\n [patient] any questions\n [doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Right foot ulcer.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.\n \n He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.\n \n In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.\n \n MEDICAL HISTORY\n \n Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.\n \n SURGICAL HISTORY\n \n Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.\n \n MEDICATIONS\n \n Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.\n Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.\n Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.\n Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.\n Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.\n \n VITALS\n \n No fever.\n Blood pressure: 127/80\n Heart rate: 60s\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.\n RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\n NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits\n MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n 1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot\n 2. Diabetes\n 3. Coronary artery disease\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.\n \n Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.\n \n The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.",

ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain\n [patient] well i'd say it's about a seven\n [doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night\n [patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up\n [doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain\n [patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping\n [doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else\n [patient] i tried a little bit of ice at first\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] did n't getting better\n [doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse\n [patient] well it's just not getting better\n [doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly\n [patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties\n [doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday\n [patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril\n [doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly\n [patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and plus i kinda have a sweet tooth so you know sometimes they're a little bit higher you know like one fifty to one seventy so\n [doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there\n [patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that\n [doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations\n [patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine\n [doctor] oof\n [patient] a long time ago and\n [doctor] so you know it's good\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage\n [patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it\n [doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a\n [patient] had some friends tell me something about that\n [doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right\n [patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too\n [doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay\n [patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were\n [doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far\n [patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] checked it in a while so\n [doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on\n [patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily\n [doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks\n [patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day\n [doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow\n [patient] it's my right\n [doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside\n [patient] yes it does\n [doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain\n [patient] no not really\n [doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain\n [patient] yeah that hurts\n [doctor] alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so\n [patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far\n [doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that\n [patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look\n [doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] do you\n [patient] just true\n [doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright no problem any other questions\n [patient] nope\n [doctor] alright thank you for keeping me accountable",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] angela good to see you today so i'm writing here in my notes that you're you're coming in you had some left knee pain so how did you hurt your knee\n [patient] yeah so i hurt my knee the other day when i was running around with my niece she she is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] and i fell and i think i twisted my knee in some kind of funky way\n [doctor] okay that that that that's not good how old are your niece\n [patient] she is five and perfect\n [doctor] well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg\n [patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago\n [doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts\n [patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside\n [doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it\n [patient] yeah i did\n [doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten\n [patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah\n [doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain\n [patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that\n [doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all\n [patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen\n [doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol\n [patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again\n [doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely\n [patient] right\n [doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt\n [patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot\n [doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound\n [patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that\n [doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days\n [patient] okay alright thanks\n [doctor] alright any other questions\n [patient] no that's it\n [doctor] alright great thanks",
    "originalNote": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Angela Powell is a pleasant 81-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left knee pain. The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she was running around with her niece and fell. At the time of the injury, she heard a pop and believes that she twisted her knee. She reports that she has been limping since the injury. The patient locates her pain to the medial and lateral aspects of her knee. She rates her pain level as a 4 out of 10, however this is increasing. Her pain is described as a throbbing pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol, which has provided mild and temporary relief, as well as wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She states that she is unable to take ibuprofen secondary to an ulcer.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n MSK: Examination of the left knee: Edema and effusion noted. Moderate ROM. Pain with flexion and extension of the knee. Negative Lachman's. Negative valgus and varus stress test.\n \n RESULTS\n \n 4 views of the left knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Left knee pain, possible MCL strain.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a tear. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The plan is to place the patient in a knee immobilizer to provide increased support for the next week. I have also prescribed the patient tramadol 50 mg to treat her pain. She can take Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain. I have also advised her to ice her left knee 3 to 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I have advised her to refrain from running for the next 3 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the immobilizer, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.",

years now\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work\n [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially\n [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend\n [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me\n [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah\n [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain\n [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] let me separate these\n [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area\n [patient] no nothing like that\n [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness\n [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no\n [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they\n [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery\n [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like\n [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years\n [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf\n [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back\n [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right\n [patient] exactly\n [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions\n [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members\n [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke\n [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago\n [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit\n [patient] okay that's painful\n [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that\n [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time\n [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year\n [patient] okay okay\n [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] alright sounds good\n [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection\n [patient] alright thank you\n [doctor] alright thank you\n [patient] bye",

and i really hurt my lower back\n [doctor] okay how long ago did that happen\n [patient] this was about four months ago\n [doctor] about four months ago okay that's quite a long time and you're just seeing me now for it\n [patient] yeah the appointments were backed up and i tried some pt at my gym but it it really did n't seem to help and i was really concerned\n [doctor] okay and what exactly are your symptoms are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time it felt like i was gon na tapple over i like i could n't support my my upper body weight and then my right toe or the the toes on my right foot tingled a little bit but that went away after about an hour okay are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone\n [patient] that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since\n [doctor] okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs\n [patient] only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy\n [doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way okay and what have you been taking for the pain\n [patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help\n [doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol\n [patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time\n [doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen\n [patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it\n [doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all\n [patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that\n [doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom\n [patient] no i have n't had any of those issues\n [doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any\n [patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] that went fine i rehabbed it pt has been fine it it feels about ninety five percent ever since\n [doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee\n [patient] it was a total knee replacement\n [doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said\n [patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty\n [doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good\n [patient] good\n [doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here\n [patient] no\n [doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that\n [patient] no questions\n [doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation\n [patient] mm-hmm\n [doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay\n [patient] sure\n [doctor] any questions\n [patient] not at this point\n [doctor] okay great thank you\n [patient] thank you",

The onset of his pain began 4 months ago, when he was moving boxes out of his sonâ€™s college dorm. At that time, he noted tingling in his right toes, which resolved after approximately 1 hour. After his injury, he felt as though he was unable to support his upper body weight. The patient reports weakness in his legs when carrying heavy objects. He reports a sharp pain in his lower back when he turns a certain way or rolls over in his sleep. The pain will resolve with repositioning. The patient was seen at urgent care and was referred to obtain an MRI, however he did not undergo this secondary to insurance issues. He has been utilizing Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat, and ice for pain, which does not provide relief. The patient notes the ibuprofen is slightly more beneficial than the Tylenol, however it does not relieve his symptoms. He denies upset stomach with the use of ibuprofen. Additionally, he attempted physical therapy at his gym without any relief. He denies any bladder or bowels issues, fevers, and chills.\n \n SURGICAL HISTORY\n \n The patient has a history of a right total knee arthroplasty 2 years ago, in spring of 2020.

do anything i just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time i was there\n [patient] okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it\n [doctor] it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending\n [patient] okay sorry i got a text and\n [doctor] well that's okay you know what i i you know i what i really you know i love to ride bikes have you you ride bike at all\n [patient] no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner\n [doctor] my gosh i love to ride i ride the lot of rails the trails i mean i go all the last year i put in over eight hundred miles on rails the trails\n [patient] yeah those those are nice\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] does it does riding your bike bother your big toe\n [doctor] no because i i kinda pedal with the the back of my feet you know on that side\n [patient] okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal\n [doctor] i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops\n [patient] okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started\n [doctor] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned\n [patient] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother\n [doctor] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot\n [patient] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine\n [doctor] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alrighty\n [patient] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom\n [doctor] yeah ouch\n [patient] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt\n [doctor] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down\n [patient] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt\n [doctor] yeah it a little when you take it a little further\n [patient] if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt\n [doctor] that hurts more yeah\n [patient] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt\n [doctor] yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too\n [patient] okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt\n [doctor] a little bit but not terrible\n [patient] okay what about if i push on the other side here\n [doctor] yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] yep\n [patient] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back\n [doctor] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in\n [patient] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint\n [doctor] oh\n [patient] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage\n [doctor] oh\n [patient] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach\n [doctor] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach\n [patient] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes\n [doctor] is that surgery\n [patient] i have to\n [doctor] would that be\n [patient] i'm sorry\n [doctor] would that be surgery clean out the joint\n [patient] yeah that would\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer\n [doctor] okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done\n [patient] no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks\n [doctor] okay where i really like catching blue going croppy so okay we'll we'll i'll i'll keep working then i'll find time to do that later\n [patient] very good we will see you in two weeks\n [doctor] okay thank you",

yesterday and dropped a landscape brick on your foot can what so what's going on with your right foot today\n [patient] it's a little sore today but you know i hurt my foot before but this is the first time where i'm actually being seen for it\n [doctor] okay so you say you've injured your right foot before tell me a little bit about that injury\n [patient] twenty years ago i broke my ankle i had to put in a cast but that seems to be okay but you know sometimes it'll give me trouble once in a while it feels a little sore it swells up at times\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and my other ankle too is sore sometimes and i've had surgery for that too and you know one of those things where you know it might give out once in a while but i'm not sure that's related to what the you know break dropping on my foot but you know either way my foot's a little sore\n [doctor] okay alright so when you dropped that brick on your foot were you able to get up and keep working or did you have to get off your you know not stop weightbearing and and get off that foot can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident\n [patient] i you know it was a little sore i called a few names you know god damn why is this in my foot but you know i kept working putting it around a little bit but now it's got swollen so i got to see my doctor he told me i had to go see you here i am so tell me what's going on with it\n [doctor] so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult\n [patient] lucken it up\n [doctor] okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain\n [patient] no i feel like taking the medicine\n [doctor] okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet\n [patient] no not yet i heard about it though i might have to make a trip once my foot heals\n [doctor] alright that sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life\n [patient] eleven out of ten\n [doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident\n [patient] yeah the whole foot is numb\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] but been now for a long time\n [doctor] okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that\n [patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast\n [doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible\n [patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri\n [doctor] so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon\n [patient] can i think about it and we have some time\n [doctor] sure\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Right foot pain.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Elijah Reyes is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The patient was referred by his primary care physician. He sustained an injury yesterday when he dropped a landscape brick on his right foot while doing yard work. He was able to get up and continue working after the injury. He rates his pain level as an 11 out of 10. The patient also reports numbness in his entire right foot, which has been present for a long time. The patient denies taking any medication for pain.\n \n The patient reports he fractured his right ankle 20 years ago. He received non-operative treatment with casting. He has experienced intermittent soreness and swelling in his right ankle since then.\n \n The patient reports surgical history of his left ankle. He continues to experience soreness and occasional giving way of the left ankle.\n \n MEDICAL HISTORY\n \n Patient reports history of a right ankle fracture 20 years ago.\n \n SURGICAL HISTORY\n \n Patient reports history of left ankle surgery.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain, right ankle soreness and swelling, and left ankle soreness and instability.\n Neurological: Reports right foot numbness.\n \n VITALS\n \n All vital signs are within the normal limits.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n CV: Capillary refill is brisk in less than 3 seconds in the right foot. Strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse.\n NEURO: Normal sensation. Right foot motor and sensation are intact and equal to the contralateral side.\n MSK: Examination of the right foot: Bruising on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. I do appreciate associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation over the midfoot.\n \n RESULTS\n \n An x-ray of the right foot was obtained and reviewed today. It demonstrates dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Right foot pain, due to a Lisfranc fracture.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I advised him that this procedure will be performed in an outpatient setting and he will be discharged home that same evening. He will then follow up with me 24 hours post procedure, and again 2 weeks later. I explained that he will be placed in a cast and will remain non-weight-bearing for 6 to 8 weeks. He will use crutches while ambulating and we will advance his weight-bearing gradually based on how he tolerates the procedure.\n \n I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right foot to further assess the ligaments. I explained to him that if he has poor bone alignment or ligament healing, this can lead to losing the arch in his foot causing pes planus and developing arthritis. I will send an order to the outpatient MRI facility downstairs for him to obtain the MRI this afternoon.\n \n The patient wishes to think over his options before proceeding with the operation.",

training for a triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when i first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf\n [doctor] okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today\n [patient] i i will run about ten klometers\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] in the morning at lunchtime i try to get on the bike for about forty five minutes to an hour\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] and then in the evening i go to the aquatic center and i jump in the pool and swim for about another thirty minutes to an hour\n [doctor] wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training\n [patient] i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i i just swimming on those other five days and i take one day off\n [doctor] okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both\n [patient] yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that\n [doctor] okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] yeah you know i you know when i first start off i go slow until i'm warmed up and then i\n [doctor] okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also\n [patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] or\n [doctor] no go ahead go ahead\n [patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too\n [doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right\n [patient] no it's mainly just on the right\n [doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that\n [patient] yeah a little bit\n [doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt\n [patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too\n [doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] no\n [doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all\n [patient] yeah\n [doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt\n [patient] that's real tender\n [doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you\n [patient] sounds good\n [doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night\n [patient] no i i was watching the track meet\n [doctor] my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here\n [patient] used to when i lived in detroit\n [doctor] oh\n [patient] hockey town but not so much anymore\n [doctor] no yeah detroit is a hockey town yeah the red wings okay well i'm gon na go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once that gets scheduled they will get you in to that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later\n [patient] thanks",

knees\n [doctor] hmmm alright now tell me what what type of activities makes that pain worse\n [patient] so i feel like the pain gets worse anytime i'm like getting from like a seated position to standing so i i work from home so i'm at my desk a lot so anytime i get up i have some pain or after watching tv or even like going up and down stairs it's really painful\n [doctor] hmmm okay and does anything make the pain feel better\n [patient] usually after i rest it for some time it does help with the pain\n [doctor] okay now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were\n [patient] yeah so when it first started hurting i was putting ice on it and i even got like some ace bandage like wrapping from the pharmacy i do take ibuprofen or aleve sometimes but i try to avoid really taking any medications\n [doctor] okay and and tell me what is your day like\n [patient] well i try to be as active as i can i actually love to run and i would run like five to six miles a day but now i i mean honestly i ca n't even get to half a mile and my leg will start hurting my knee will start hurting\n [doctor] okay that's definitely a decrease in your mileage there where have you been running lately like do you run outside or on a treadmill or\n [patient] yeah i i you know i will do the treadmill during the winter but i just love being outdoors and running\n [doctor] yeah yeah there are some really nice senior routes here in boston is n't there like\n [patient] there are\n [doctor] so many knee places there's some right by the harbor that i've i've done some runs there before too it's pretty nice well i mean the boston marathon what can you say right\n [patient] right exactly exactly no it's very nice\n [doctor] well okay well hopefully that we get you feeling better so you can start running again more than . five miles but tell me though have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees\n [patient] no not really\n [doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before\n [patient] no i've been pretty good i actually have never broken a bone actually no i'm gon na change that actually i did break my arm when i was in sixth grade but nothing since then\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] i\n [doctor] okay and it's just your arm right not not your knee\n [patient] right\n [doctor] okay well alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here let me look at your vital signs okay i reviewed your vitals they they overall they look good take a listen to your heart real quick alright and your heart exam i hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and on your musculoskeletal exam i have seen you and walk around here and you do have normal gait alright now i'm gon na have you do some movements on your legs here okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel\n [patient] it does\n [doctor] sorry so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinacular retinaculum and there is positive patellar grind test alright and can you are you able to squat for me\n [patient] i can but that hurts\n [doctor] okay alright so you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting and i'm just gon na maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick okay so lachman anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray tests are all negative bilaterally so that's good there okay now your neuro exam patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so now i did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that\n [patient] will i be able to run anytime soon\n [doctor] well that is a goal of treatment and to get you back in running again now you will have to take an take it easy from running for now but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright anything else\n [patient] no i think that's it\n [doctor] okay well very good well i will be following up with you soon and again just take it easy for now from the running

These demonstrate no evidence of any fractures or osteoarthritis.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Bilateral knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of formal physical therapy to increase her lower extremity strength, mobility, and correct any incorrect running mechanics. I encouraged her to take running easy for now. She can continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatories as needed for pain. All questions were answered.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n The patient will follow up with me soon.",

that every six to eight hours i also wan na give you a muscle relaxant called flexeril and it's gon na be ten milligrams and you'll take that every twelve hours as needed i'm gon na want you to try your best to to like relax your neck i'm sorry not to strain your neck anymore like to be conservative with how you move about and everything like that i also wan na order an mri just because you said you did n't go to the hospital or anything like that i just wan na make sure that you you're not suffering from like a concussion but this is something that's commonly referred to as like whiplash right your head just like it it just wiped essentially like back and forth to so severely and and that's probably what's causing your pain i think i wan na refer you to either physical rehab or a chiropractor once we get the results of the mri just to make sure that there is n't any impingement of like the nerves or anything like that do you have any questions\n [patient] i heard the chiropractors will shake they work\n [doctor] i do understand that some people have like reservations about going to the chiropractor but you know we do have some good ones that have like longstanding histories and patients that have had positive results from the experience but if you if you do n't like the idea of that we can consider other options like that rehab and physical therapy\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright any other questions\n [patient] no\n [doctor] alright thank you",

like i had to be held from the field because i could n't put weight on my foot\n [doctor] i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then\n [patient] i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen\n [doctor] okay could you one more time

[patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot\n [doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out\n [patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep\n [doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah\n [patient] that scares me\n [doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt\n [patient] no uh uh\n [doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions\n [patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery\n [doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with\n [patient] i just hate that word surgery doc\n [doctor] i know\n [patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too\n [doctor] so it's actually\n [patient] have to be in the hospital\n [doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed\n [patient] i'm right handed\n [doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what\n [patient] i mean\n [doctor] uh uh\n [patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but\n [doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there\n [patient] i suppose so\n [doctor] yeah\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] thank you\n [doctor] no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright\n [patient] good\n [doctor] thank you\n [patient] thank you",

The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.\n \n The patient has a history of a left leg injury.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.\n Neurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n SKIN: Warm\n NEURO: Normal sensation.\n MSK:\n Examination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.\n Examination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.\n \n RESULTS\n \n 3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n Right foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.\n \n PLAN\n \n After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.",

is a no judgment zone i there i'm working through some things in my head to make sure that i give you the best care that we need right i'm making a plan as we move along you mentioned that the pain has been getting worse have you done anything or tried anything that's worked in the past\n [patient] i tried to take some ibuprofen and tylenol\n [doctor] mm-hmm\n [patient] that that sometimes helps\n [doctor] okay alright and has anyone discussed the option of like just no has anyone discussed surgery with you\n [patient] no this is the first time i'm talking about it\n [doctor] okay

[patient] yes\n [doctor] okay what did you play\n [patient] soccer\n [doctor] okay what position\n [patient] i played midfield\n [doctor] okay the people who hide in the back that's fine i was centered forward fine no baby do you have a team that you wrote for\n [patient] you know i am a tatnham hotsper fan\n [doctor] they have the best colors not going to lie but i i grew up manu so sorry\n [patient] well i wo n't fault you for that\n [doctor] thanks okay so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings just to have them recorded and if you have any questions please feel free to stop me and let me know okay\n [patient] okay\n [doctor] alright so looking at your vitals your blood pressure seems alright we are in like the one thirty over seventy range that's perfectly fine your respiratory rate i have you at an eighteen again pretty normal when i listen here to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops that means your heart sounds great on your respiratory exam your lungs sound clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal back exam as i'm looking here i do n't notice any overlying redness or bruising on the skin when i push here on the midline of your back does it hurt\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] okay so there is midline tenderness at the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness alright so are you able to bend forward\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] alright and are you able to bend backward\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] alright do either of those actions cause you pain\n [patient] bending forward\n [doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and so i'm gon na have you lie down and we're gon na do i'm sorry okay and then i see that a supine straight leg test is positive alright so for your neurological exam you said that you are experiencing pain radiating down radiating down your left leg correct\n [patient] yes\n [doctor] alright when i touch are there any like decreased sensation\n [patient] no\n [doctor] okay alright so patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so i received before you came in here we got an mri and so in reviewing your results it does show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right neuroforaminal i do n't like this word neural foraminal stenosis what those complicated words is that i just said is that it seems that you have a a a herniated disk with nerve impingement so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright your symptoms are in line with a i'm sorry you have lumbar back pain at the l4 l5 disk space due to a herniated disk with radiculopathy this means that one of your disks that sits between your vertebrae like the bones in your spine is bulging out and the bulge is pinching on some nerves so that's why you are feeling that pain like radiating down your leg i'm gon na recommend something a spinal injection with a strong nsaid and called the i'm sorry and a corticosteroid i'm just gon na inject it into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of like an x-ray to localize the exact area of your pain this should help with the inflammation that's causing your pain i know that sounds a bit scary it this is a typical procedure that i do all the time it's in office and we can get you scheduled today if you would like so what questions do you have right now\n [patient] is that something that we can do today\n [doctor] yeah i think i have time in my schedule to get it done today just you know i'm here for you right now\n [patient] alright\n [doctor] okay\n [patient] are there are there any complications with this\n [doctor] there are sorry yeah you're right there

laundry\n[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally\n[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere\n[patient] no not really\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just really along my wrist\n[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling\n[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling\n[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well\n[patient] yeah it does\n[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like\n[patient] not without extreme pain\n[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up\n[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually\n[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright and then lateral as well\n[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason\n[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist\n[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight\n[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you\n[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all\n[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down\n[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better\n[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] pardon what\n[patient] a what\n[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay\n[patient] when do i have to have the surgery\n[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so what\n[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace\n[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks\n[patient] six weeks\n[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of\n[patient] oof\n[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions\n[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so\n[doctor] okay how long is the vacation\n[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks\n[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks\n[patient] no vacation in a month\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] no problem bye\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight wrist injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDiana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well.\n\nThe patient is going on vacation in 1 month.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right wrist pain and swelling.\nNeurological: Reports numbness and tingling to the digits of the right hand.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg.\nHeart Rate: 80 beats per minute.\nRespiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute.\nBody Temperature: 97.2 degrees F.\nHEAD: Normocephalic\nNECK: No swelling noted\nCV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities.\nRESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nGI/GU: Non-distended\nBACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity\nNECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly.\nMSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight wrist Colles fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.\n\nIn the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.\n",

like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?\n [patient] no , not that i can remember .\n [doctor] okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?\n [patient] yeah .\n [doctor] okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?\n [patient] yeah , it comes and goes , but right now it's been doing really well .\n [doctor] okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ?\n [patient] no .\n [doctor] okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ?\n [patient] that's been going really well .\n [doctor] okay .\n [patient] with the medication and therapy and then trying to get outside more it's been really helping me .\n [doctor] sleeping well ?\n [patient] yeah .\n [doctor] eating well ?

i wan na go ahead and order a stress test for you to see if you have more blockages that could be causing this chest discomfort , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and i'm gon na go ahead and get a lipid panel and , uh , start you on crestor 20 mg , once a day , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] hey dragon , order a cardiac stress test . do you have any questions ?\n[patient] no , that's it .\n[doctor] okay , all right . hey dragon , finalize the note . so , it was good to see you , the nurse will come in , she'll help you get your scheduled for all of those things , and i'll be in touch , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] take care .",

The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and a full chest pain for approximately hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.\n \n The patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.\n \n His blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n \n Neck\n â€¢ General Examination: I do feel a little large thyroid that is not tender. She has a carotid bruit on the right side. \n \n Respiratory\n â€¢ Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. Cardiovascular\n â€¢ Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, but I do hear 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Gastrointestinal\n â€¢ Examination of Abdomen: Soft.

He presented to the emergency room for chest pain and elevated blood pressure of 180/95. His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.\n \n Chest pain and hypertension.\n â€¢ Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.\n â€¢ Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.\n \n Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",

He had some right lower extremity weakness and some drop foot that he felt that for a while, and it got a little better this morning but not much. He had surgery about 10 years ago in his lower back.\n \n Regarding his congestive heart failure, he has been watching his diet and trying to exercise regularly. He is avoiding the salty foods and has been compliant with medications. He has gained a little weight over the summer but nothing more than 5 pounds. He has no problems lying flat to go to bed.\n \n Regarding his diabetes, he is watching his blood sugars at home, not always consistently. He is still on his metformin.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n â€¢ Constitutional: Denies weight loss. Endorses weight gain.\n â€¢ Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain. Endorses right leg weakness and drop foot.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n \n â€¢ Cardiovascular: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n â€¢ Musculoskeletal: Examination of his back reveals pain to palpation at L5. Decreased range of motion with flexion and extension. Positive straight leg raise. Strength is 4/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left.\n \n Results:\n \n X-ray lumbar spine, ordered and obtained in the office today, is unremarkable with good bony alignment.\n \n Hemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8.\n \n ASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n \n James Allen is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes, who presents today with back pain.\n \n Acute lumbar strain.\n â€¢ Medical Reasoning: The patient reports feeling a 'pop' and immediate pain while golfing approximately 4 days ago. He has tried Tylenol and ibuprofen without significant relief.\n â€¢ Additional Testing: If he continues to have pain, we will obtain an MRI for further evaluation.\n â€¢ Medical Treatment: Initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.\n â€¢ Specialist Referrals: We will refer him to physical therapy to work on strengthening the area.\n \n Diabetes type 2.\n â€¢ Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with metformin and dietary modifications, but his recent hemoglobin A1c was 8.\n â€¢ Additional Testing: Repeat hemoglobin A1c in a couple of months.\n â€¢ Medical Treatment: Increase metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.\n \n Congestive heart failure.\n â€¢ Medical Reasoning: He is doing well from this standpoint.

Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees.\n â€¢ Neurological: Denies headaches.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n \n â€¢ Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n â€¢ Musculoskeletal: There is edema and erythema of the right knee with pain to palpation. Range of motion is decreased. Left knee exam is normal.\n \n RESULTS\n \n X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No acute fractures.\n \n Labs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal.\n \n ASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n \n Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.\n \n Arthritis.\n â€¢ Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis.\n â€¢ Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.\n â€¢ Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed.\n â€¢ Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy.\n \n Hypothyroidism.\n â€¢ Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time.\n â€¢ Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel.\n â€¢ Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid.\n \n Status post renal transplant.\n â€¢ Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable.\n â€¢ Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.\n \n Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",

it's when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm , and whatever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it . so , it's part of the atrial fibrillation .\n[patient] wow , that sounds like a mess .\n[doctor] yeah , it's not ideal . but , many people have a-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes .\n[patient] agh , i see . that's good to know .\n[doctor] okay . so , s1 slightly accentuated , no s3 . i'm going to touch your belly , and does any of that hurt .\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] how about there ?

thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 .\n[doctor] hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?\n[patient] i'm fine , thank you .\n[doctor] good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .\n[patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .\n[doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .\n[patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .\n[doctor] do you have a family history of this ?\n[patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .\n[doctor] i see .\n[patient] yeah , i thought it was getting better , and , uh , i have a new primary doctor , and she put me on a new medication about a month ago .\n[doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?\n[patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .\n[doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .\n[patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .\n[doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?\n[patient] uh , yes i am .\n[doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?\n[patient] um , every day .\n[doctor] awesome .\n[patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .\n[doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ?\n[patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .\n[doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?\n[patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .\n[doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] are you doing any exercise ?\n[patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .\n[doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .\n[patient] good to hear .\n[doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .\n[patient] nope . nowhere .\n[doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .\n[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?\n[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .\n[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .\n[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .\n[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .\n[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .\n[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?\n[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .\n[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .\n[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .\n[patient] i understand .\n[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .\n[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .\n[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .\n[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .\n[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .\n[patient] that's interesting .\n[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .\n[patient] sounds good to me .\n[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .\n[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .\n[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .\n[patient] will do .\n[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHigh blood pressure and palpitations.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.\n\nIn March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.\n\nHe has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.\n\nHe has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSeveral family members positive for hypertension.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nBenicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg\nAmlodipine 10 mg daily.\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.\n\nPulmonary/Chest\nBreath sounds normal. \n\nAbdominal\nThere is no tenderness.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nThere is no edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThyroid profile 03/01/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Resistant hypertension.\n\nMr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.\n\nPLAN\n\nI have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.\n\nI provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSchedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.\n",

today ?\n[patient] i'm good , thank you .\n[doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?\n[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .\n[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?\n[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .\n[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?\n[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .\n[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?\n[patient] no , i definitely do n't .\n[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?\n[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .\n[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?\n[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .\n[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?\n[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .\n[doctor] got it . all right .\n[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .\n[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?\n[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .\n[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?\n[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .\n[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?\n[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .\n[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?\n[patient] i do n't notice it at all .\n[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?\n[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .\n[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?\n[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .\n[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?\n[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .\n[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .\n[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .\n[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?\n[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .\n[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?\n[patient] i'm not really sure .\n[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?\n[patient] yeah , you name it .\n[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?\n[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .\n[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .\n[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .\n[doctor] okay , i see .\n[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .\n[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .\n[patient] all right . sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?\n[patient] no , i feel fine .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .\n[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .\n[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .\n[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .\n[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .\n[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .\n[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .\n[patient] really ?\n[doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .\n[patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .\n[patient] okay , i will .\n[doctor] all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?\n[patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .\n[doctor] okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHeart murmur.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDiana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of a heart murmur.\n\nMs. Scott has been recently diagnosed with a â€œnew, worrisomeâ€ heart murmur. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling â€œoverly tiredâ€ but attributes this to her polypharmacy.\n\nThe patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHyperlipidemia.\nHypertension.\nHypothyroid.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nRequires a walker to ambulate.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSon had a myocardial infarction.\nBrother had a stroke and has diabetes.\nOlder sister has an unknown heart problem.\nFamily is positive for heart disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nLevothyroxine.\nLisinopril.\nSimvastatin 20 mg.\nMeclizine.\nAmlodipine.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nElderly, no acute distress.\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal S1, S2 preserved, irregular rhythm and normal rate. 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLower extremity edema\n\nNeurologic\nGait normal for age.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEKG\nImpression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Cardiac murmur.\nâ€¢ PVCs.\nâ€¢ Hypertension.\nâ€¢ Hyperlipidemia.\nâ€¢ Hypothyroid.\nâ€¢ Lightheadedness/dizziness.\n\nPLAN\n\nCardiac murmur\nDiana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.\n\nPVCs\nHer referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.\n\nHypertension\nShe is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nThis is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.\n\nHypothyroidism\nShe takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.\n\nLightheadedness/dizziness\nShe is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.\n",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nNew acne evaluation.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nKayla Ward is a 15-year-old female who presents for new patient evaluation of acne located on the face. She is accompanied by her mother today.\n\nKayla states her acne started approximately 2 years ago and it is present almost every day. The patientâ€™s mother notes that the most significant acne flares started in the fall when she was playing school sports. It does not tend to flare with her periods. Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.\n\nThe patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nLives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home. She is in the 7th grade and active in basketball, volleyball, and tap dancing.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo significant family medical history.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nFull exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra. There are multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities. Scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, with also some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of examination is normal.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Comedonal acne.\nâ€¢ Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\n\nKayla Ward is a 15-year-old female seen today for new acne evaluation. Full skin examination revealed mild to moderate comedonal acne with a small inflammatory component and multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\n\nPLAN\n\nComedonal acne.\nWe discussed the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment options. I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter. Your topical retinoid will cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.\n\nMultiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\nReassurance given moles are normal in appearance and have no concerning characteristics. Will continue to monitor for progression or changes in 6 months.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow recommended cleaning regimen.\nStart Retin-A 0.1% topical gel, apply to acne prone areas, titrate as instructed.\nFollow up in 6 months.\n",

. good . how are you ?\n[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .\n[patient] yes . it's doing much better .\n[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?\n[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .\n[doctor] okay , that sounds good .\n[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .\n[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?\n[patient] no , i'm not right now .\n[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .\n[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .\n[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .\n[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .\n[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .\n[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .\n[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?\n[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?\n[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?\n[patient] twice a day .\n[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?\n[patient] no , that's fine .\n[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] how often are you using that one ?\n[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .\n[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?\n[patient] i'm not .\n[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?\n[patient] no wipes .\n[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?\n[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .\n[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?\n[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .\n[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .\n[patient] it is ? okay .\n[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .\n[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .\n[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .\n[patient] yes , i did . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .\n[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .\n[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] let's see .\n[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .\n[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .\n[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .\n[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .\n[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .\n[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .\n[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?\n[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .\n[patient] can you do the metro market ?\n[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .\n[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?\n[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .\n[patient] okay . got it .\n[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?\n[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .\n[doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \"\n[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?\n[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?\n[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .\n[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .\n[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .\n[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .\n[patient] that sounds good .\n[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .\n[patient] thank you so much .\n[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .\n[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?\n[patient] yeah , sounds good .\n[doctor] do you have enough refills ?\n[patient] yeah , i think so .\n[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .\n[patient] yes , i do .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .\n[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?\n[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .\n[patient] okay , thank you .\n[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for perioral dermatitis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPerioral dermatitis.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nDoxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.\nMetroCream. \nSulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nSkin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Perioral dermatitis\nâ€¢ Rosacea, including ocular rosacea\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacistâ€™s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.\n\nPLAN\n\nPerioral dermatitis.\nI counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.\n\nRosacea, including ocular rosacea.\nContinue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nCall the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks.",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez . date of birth is january 13 , 1982 . hey miss christine , how are you doing today ? [patient] i'm good , thanks , how are you ? [doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [patient] yes , i did . [doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine . the one that you prescribed as i'm still taking my old one , the price is a little high on the new one . [doctor] okay , so did , did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [patient] i did not try the coupon . there was a charge of $ 75 . [doctor] okay , well , next time that , that coupon should help , but it should only be about three dollars . [patient] okay . i do n't have it . do you happen to have another one you can give me ? [doctor] yep , right here . [patient] wonderful . thank you so much and and then the gel they are charging me $ 100 for it , so i do n't know if this is because it's a , it's walmart or if i should try somewhere else or maybe you know how or where i could get it cheaper . [doctor] yeah , let's try something else . sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper so that we can do , the unithroid with the discount code should only be about nine dollars for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great , yeah , they were charging me $ 75 and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we try a different pharmacy as well . [patient] okay . so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it at least , so i would need to see the , the hyper and dragonism or high testosterone or a high dhea to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff , but the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said , your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study and you mentioned that i have some meal plans that you had given me , i still have those two . [doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freeer since i'll be on vacation after july 8 . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla because it's supposed to help your metabolism , is that okay to take ? [doctor] i'm not sure , what is the cla ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is either . [doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so . [patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss . [doctor] so that likely will not help too much . you could try it either if you really want to but then they will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt like i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but it also wo n't help that much , so it's up to you . [patient] okay and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that i might find them in certain foods i guess for my workout . [doctor] yeah , amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated . [patient] okay , are they proteins , my cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day but she does n't work , so i do n't know . [doctor] yes , i mean acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat with any protein , so meat , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [patient] okay , thank you , got it . [doctor] alright are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] no , not that i know of . [doctor] okay . is your skin pretty sensitive ? [patient] yes . [doctor] alright . [patient] yeah , on my sides , i will start getting rashes with different products . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne ? [patient] no , i've never tried anything for it . [doctor] okay . we may give you some of that . [patient] okay and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm , i'm gon na take a look at that for just a moment . any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] alright . miralax will definitely help with that . [patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that . [doctor] great . alright , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . deep breath , alright again . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , they look okay right now . certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [patient] okay , i'll do that . [doctor] now let's go over your lab work . so when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing syndrome on that test at least . the salivary cortisol though unless you did one wrong , two of them were completely normal , one was abnormal , so we might need to repeat that in the future . [patient] okay , that's okay . [doctor] alright , so your cholesterol was quite high , the total cholesterol was 222 , good cholesterol was about 44 , the bad was 153 and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 and it was 44 . so your screening for diabetes is was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency and i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet or not . [patient] yes , we did . i , i do need to take one today though . [doctor] okay . so i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels , everything else seemed to be pretty good and in decent range . [patient] okay , that sounds great . so i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because i have n't come back since then , but i was also happy because one of them was back to normal . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay , so the one that's 30 that was almost 200 , not so long ago . [doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [patient] okay and , and back in october it was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [patient] okay , great , and then it dropped in january and then it dropped a little more in march since i stopped taking the medicine in december . [doctor] okay , that's good . so i'm proud of you with the course of your labs so before i forget , i'm gon na just put your labs into the computer today and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so with the thyroid and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] i do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [doctor] this is what i'm , i'm going to do , i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [patient] okay , good . so the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start or how does that work ? [doctor] so we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork , so we can get started . [patient] okay and what's involved with that ? [doctor] so it'll involve you receiving a medication , which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones . the most common side effects are gon na be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation , there are six arms to the study , one is the placebo , the other ones are various , various dosages of the medication , excuse me , you would receive an injection once a week also keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so it's a way of getting them but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor right might be only 1 out of 5 of our 100 patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] so we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in the diabetes study , so it's a year long process and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four or 5 weeks , i believe and then after that it's once a month . you do get a stype in for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study . [patient] okay , do you know how much the skypond is ? [doctor] i will have to double check for you and you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 if you do n't have any other medical condition or a bmi greater than 27 if you do have other medical condition like your cholesterol bmi greater than 27 would qualify you . [patient] i have a friend who might be interested and she does have diabetes . [doctor] if she has the diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [patient] okay . you ca n't if you , if you have diabetes , got it . [doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that they can not have really is diabetes , severe psychiatric disease or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [patient] okay . [doctor] but if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that , they can definitely sign up . [patient] and they can , okay , thank you for explaining that . [doctor] of course , so do you want me to try to get you into that study or would you just like to try me to prescribe you something , it's kinda up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] alright . sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research . it's just in my office . it is a different phone number though so then if you're interested , just call us within a month because i do n't know how long the , the wait will be . [patient] okay , we will do . [doctor] perfect . so let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance . then show them this and ask how much it will cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [patient] i will , thank you so much for your help on that . [doctor] you're welcome . then what i did is i gave you a topical antibiotic plus i gave you the benzyl peroxide so the peroxide may bleach your sheets . but you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] but you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] so that's that and then let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low cholesterol foods . [patient] okay . [doctor] and again once you finish your dose of vitamin d for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000 international units daily so that you're able to maintain those levels , sound good ? [patient] yes , that sounds great . [doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are gon na get better once you lose the weight though . [patient] okay , that would be great . [doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try one called fexie , which is kind of like a spermaside basically . [patient] okay . [doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [patient] okay . [doctor] if you need some just let me know . [patient] okay , i will , i will let you know . [doctor] okay , perfect . so stay put for me now . i'm gon na go see if they have a discount samples and bring you that prescription and then i'm going to order the labs for next time . [patient] okay , great . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome . so under the plan under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal , 2 out of 3 solid chorisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's and therefore , ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we will try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information on the hypothyroidism . we will print out her prescriptions unithyroid should be better priced with the discount card and we will repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Follow-up for diabetes management, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Maria Martin is a 75-year-old female who presents today for follow-up for diabetes.\n \n The patientâ€™s blood glucose levels are poorly controlled and her most recent hemoglobin A1C is 9.9%. She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.\n \n She confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.\n \n The patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.\n \n Ms. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.\n \n She is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.\n \n The patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.\n \n PAST HISTORY\n \n Medical\n Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n Hypertension.\n Hyperlipidemia.\n Peripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n Current tobacco smoker.\n \n CURRENT MEDICATIONS\n \n Metoprolol 50 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.\n Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.\n Amlodipine 10 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.\n Atorvastatin tablet.\n Metformin.\n Glimepiride 4mg tablet. Take 2 tablets by oral route 2 times per day.\n \n VITALS\n \n Blood pressure 140/60.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n Respiratory\n No rasping, wheezing.\n \n Cardiovascular\n Normal heart rate and regular rhythm. Carotids and pulses are normal. S1 and S2 are crisp. No murmurs.\n \n Gastrointestinal\n No nausea or vomiting.\n \n Extremities\n Bilateral Diabetic Foot Exam: No edema with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. No skin breakdown. Thickened nails.\n Sensory Examination: Mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes bilaterally.\n \n RESULTS\n \n Hemoglobin A1C 9.9%.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n â€¢ Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n â€¢ Hypertension.\n â€¢ Hyperlipidemia.\n â€¢ Peripheral vascular disease.\n \n PLAN\n \n Type 2 diabetes mellitus\n Increase glimepiride to 4 mg tablets two times per day. I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I donâ€™t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.\n \n Peripheral vascular disease\n I counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.\n \n Hypertension\n Blood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.\n \n Hyperlipidemia\n I will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n Finish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.",

you .\n[doctor] thanks for coming in today .\n[patient] yeah , no problem .\n[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?\n[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .\n[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?\n[patient] on monday .\n[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah i have .\n[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?\n[patient] yep .\n[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?\n[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .\n[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .\n[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .\n[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?\n[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .\n[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?\n[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .\n[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?\n[patient] mm , no .\n[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?\n[patient] yes . yes i am .\n[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?\n[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .\n[doctor] uh- .\n[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .\n[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .\n[patient] right , mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of

everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .\n[patient] yeah i agree with that .\n[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .\n[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?\n[doctor] it actually will help with both .\n[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?\n[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .\n[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .\n[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .\n[patient] yeah , sure , sure .\n[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .\n[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .\n[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .\n[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .\n[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?\n[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .\n[patient] all right that sounds good .\n[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .\n[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .\n[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .\n[patient] you too

[patient] no , it did get bad for a while , so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one . [doctor] okay . [patient] i did that for like gosh , i think it was 2 weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since . [doctor] great . [patient] and after i start taking that i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now . [doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ? [patient] yeah , that's right . [doctor] alright , let's , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past , but that is still doing great . [patient] good , that's a relief to hear . [doctor] your potassium is 3.9 , so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was 0.7 , 9.8 , so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your your bun . [patient] maybe a tiny bit elevated at 23 which the number we look for for dehydration , sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . [doctor] so when i look at your numbers as a whole , i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number . i sent out to look at your heart failure number . [patient] there is a test called a bnp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3000 and then went up to 6000 in april before i made the change and i'm still waiting for those results . okay . [doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though . [patient] what about what's it called a1c , does that show up ? [doctor] i do n't think i ordered it , but i could , your last a1c was 5.5 in march . [patient] already . [doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kinda depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check , so i might have to repeat that test for preop , but i do n't think we need to do it today . [patient] alrighty , that sounds good . i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you , you urinate out magnesium and with the water pills , but it was normal at 1.7 and your , your blood pressure is also looking good . okay , great . that all sounds awesome . [doctor] alright , let's take a quick listen . use my general physical exam template and take a couple of deep breaths for me . your lungs sound pretty good to me , so keep doing what you're doing like i said , i think you're doing good overall , but let's just talk about a few things . [patient] alrighty . [doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium , [patient] and get their levels up to around the twoâ€“-ish range . yours is a little bit less than two and we want that twoâ€“-ish range because because it can help stabilize the heart muscle so i might recommend putting you on a magnesium supplement . it's to be twice a day , so that's kind of annoying . but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too so i think you'll do fine . yeah that will be okay . great now before surgery , we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand . yes , okay . i have everything written down on my phone and i have a letter taped the side of my bed to remind me . [doctor] perfect . we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a preop check within 2 weeks after surgery during the first or second week of june . [patient] okay . i'll put that down . you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekg's we do n't need to do any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently and we do n't need anymore blood work because we did that today . yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular , but i'm happy to do one today , no problem . [doctor] lastly once we get your knee surgery we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ? [patient] yeah , i have both . [doctor] okay , so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like . okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out , might we be able to get the procedure done sooner maybe in the next 30 days , is that okay ? [patient] i could put it in right now for for county for the next 30 days and then might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take it should not make you an eligible for the surgery . in other words , completing the colonoscopy would not delay your surgery . [doctor] okay good . [patient] so let me see , i've been doing one of two things and everyone , and everyone is great , so it depends more on timing and availability of their or for the colonoscopy we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical and they do it at springfield . [doctor] okay that sounds good . [patient] i think either direction they are good technicians of the colon okay , yeah , whatever you can get me in , that works great . [doctor] so i'll call around , now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years , then you'll be good to go . [patient] great , thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . have a great day and let us know if you need anything else , okay . [patient] sounds good . alright assessment and plan , chronic chf , mixed presentation , had a exacerbation of cf chf earlier in the spring , we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about three , 3-1/2 pounds down in weight . breathing is nonlabored , and going to repeat ekg today , but otherwise continue her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate . # 2 , preop examination , she is , she is having a , a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed , which we will try to have done at county hospital in the next month prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer . the next one is . [doctor] diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check , so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nNicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.\n\nI last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.\n\nThe patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.\n\nShe is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.\n\nRegarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original \"stomach medication\".\n\nThe patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nChronic Congestive Heart Failure.\nIron deficiency Anemia.\n\nMedications\nPrilosec.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo family history of colon cancer.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nTorsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.\nLisinopril 10 mg daily.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMagnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.\n03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.\nâ€¢ Preop examination.\nâ€¢ Diabetes mellitus.\nâ€¢ Colonoscopy\n\nPLAN\n\nChronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.\nShe had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.\n\nPreop examination.\nShe is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.\n\nDiabetes mellitus.\nA1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.\n\nColonoscopy.\nThe patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.\n\nThe patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nComplete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.\n",

[patient] yes , i am . [doctor] hi , my name is dr. edwards , nice to meet you . [patient] nice to meet you . [doctor] welcome to the gi specialty clinic . [patient] thank you . [doctor] did you have any problems finding this ? [patient] no , i've been here with my sister once before . [doctor] good , so how can i help you today ? the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea . [patient] right so i've had been having this pain right here in my stomach like right around here . [doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen just below the belly button ? [patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about 2 years . i finally went to the er and a a few months ago and they did a ct scan . [doctor] i saw that . [patient] yeah , they said they did n't really see anything on the scan . [doctor] yes , i agree , it looked normal . [patient] and the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea . [doctor] is the pain there all the time ? [patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends , sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't . [doctor] has this been the case over the past 2 years as well ? [patient] more recently in the past couple of months at least with the constipation and diarrhea . [doctor] and before that , how were your bowel movements ? [patient] they were normal . [doctor] okay , so any blood in your stool ? [patient] nope . [doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ? [patient] probably more constipation . [doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ? [patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard . [doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ? [patient] about 3-4 times a week it's like when i need to go to the bathroom if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go . [doctor] okay and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ? [patient] yeah . it gets a little better . [doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay , any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ? [patient] none of that . [doctor] okay , so tell me about the diarrhea . how often do you get it ? [patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce i'm probably gon na have diarrhea . [doctor] okay and does it happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ? [patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over . [doctor] and how has your weight been , any fluctuation ? [patient] no , it's been pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds . [doctor] okay , and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ? [patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even though i have never been diagnosed with it . [doctor] okay and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ? [patient] no . [doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [patient] i have never had any surgery . [doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all of those are still intact ? [patient] yep . [doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [patient] no . i thought that happened when you turned 50 . [doctor] well that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [patient] okay . [doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [patient] okay . [doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my stethoscope . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [patient] what does that mean , is everything okay ? [doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so now i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen , let me know if you have any pain . [patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side near my belly button . [doctor] okay , i do feel stool in your lower colon which would coincide with constipation but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [patient] yes . i had a physical about 4 months ago and they i had blood drawn then . [doctor] okay and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes but we would recheck them in about 6 months . [doctor] and do you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated . [doctor] and do you take any medications either prescription or over the counter ? [patient] i take crestor and , and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasional , occasional pain . [doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ? [patient] hardly ever , maybe once a month . [doctor] and do you consume alcohol ? [patient] yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays . [doctor] okay and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ? [patient] no . [doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ? [patient] nope . [doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay , i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [patient] what would cause that ? [doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [patient] okay . [doctor] lungs are clear bilateral . heart sounds are normal . no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [patient] that's good . [doctor] yes , the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [patient] what's that ? [doctor] increased stool burden means that there is a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ? [doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [patient] but you said mom was slightly enlarged . [doctor] correct . [patient] so what does that mean ? [doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [patient] okay . [doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . [patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ? [doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . [patient] so what about my liver , why is it enlarged ? [doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also an enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to the liver . alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . [patient] so what do i need to do ? [doctor] well , i think since it's been about 4 months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . [patient] okay and then what ? [doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results , you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . [patient] which medications ? [doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ? [patient] about 18 months . [doctor] okay , well crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity , so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives . [patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ? [doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol . [patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon . [doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that . [patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ? [doctor] hopefully within the next 2 weeks , you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up . [patient] okay and then what happens ? [doctor] when i get the results from the tests , i'll contact you and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps . [patient] and when should i see you again ? [doctor] let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in 4 weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver . [patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ? [doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day , in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation and be mindful of eating foods that you are sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea . [patient] okay and i will talk to my primary care about my crestor . [doctor] excellent and do you have any other questions for me ? [patient] i do n't think so . [doctor] great . so remember when you check out at the front desk , schedule a follow-up appointment with me for 4 weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound . [patient] alright . thanks dr. edwards . [doctor] thank you mr. allen .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAbdominal pain and diarrhea.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nPatrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.\n\nMr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a â€œnagging feelingâ€ when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.\n\nIn addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.\n\nThe patientâ€™s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patientâ€™s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.\n\nThe patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\nLungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n\nCardiovascular\nNo murmurs, gallops, or rubs.\n\nAbdomen\nNormoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. There is mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation, mild hepatomegaly, and increased stool burden in colon.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT of Abdomen, 01/23/2020.\nImpression: Normal CT of abdomen.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Constipation\nâ€¢ Mild hepatomegaly\n\nPLAN\n\nPatrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.\n\nConstipation\nâ€¢ Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.\nâ€¢ Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.\n\nMild Hepatomegaly\nâ€¢ Repeat liver enzyme labs today.\nâ€¢ Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.\nâ€¢ Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.\nâ€¢ Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nReturn to clinic in 4 weeks.\n",

She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.\n \n The patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.\n \n Ms. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.\n \n PAST HISTORY\n \n Medical\n Anxiety.\n \n Surgical\n Surgery as an infant for â€œtwisted intestines.â€\n \n Procedures\n Possible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n Works as a paralegal.\n \n FAMILY HISTORY\n \n Maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.\n \n CURRENT MEDICATIONS\n \n Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily.\n \n ALLERGIES\n \n Seasonal environmental allergies.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n â€¢â€¯Constitutional Symptoms:â€¯ Positive for loss of appetite.\n â€¢â€¯Gastrointestinal:â€¯Negative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.\n â€¢â€¯Psychiatric:â€¯ Positive for stress and anxiety.\n â€¢â€¯Allergic/Immunologic:â€¯ Positive for seasonal allergies.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n Gastrointestinal\n There is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n The patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.\n \n â€¢ GERD\n â€¢ Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.\n \n PLAN\n \n â€¢ I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.\n â€¢ I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.\n â€¢ I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.\n â€¢ If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.\n â€¢ The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.\n â€¢ She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n â€¢ Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.\n â€¢ Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.\n â€¢ Schedule EGD.\n â€¢ Call with any changes or problems.\n â€¢ Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD.",

was last seen in august of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl .\n[doctor] she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started .\n[doctor] hello , how are you ?\n[patient] i'm okay .\n[doctor] good . how have you been feeling ?\n[patient] not so good .\n[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .\n[patient] yeah , i have .\n[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .\n[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .\n[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .\n[patient] i've been getting both .\n[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?\n[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .\n[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?\n[patient] um , they're formed .\n[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?\n[patient] yeah , i do .\n[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?\n[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .\n[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .\n[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .\n[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?\n[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .\n[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?\n[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .\n[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?\n[patient] like what i eat ?\n[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .\n[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .\n[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?\n[patient] yeah , for the most part .\n[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .\n[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .\n[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?\n[patient] no , not really .\n[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .\n[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .\n[patient] can i get a refill of that ?\n[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .\n[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .\n[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?\n[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .\n[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?\n[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .\n[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .\n[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .\n[doctor] so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs .\n[doctor] she can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed . however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects and issues , or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nEsophagitis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBetty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.\n\nThe patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.\n\nThe patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nUterine fibroids.\nAnemia.\n\nSurgical\nCholecystectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNone reported.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nâ€¢â€¯Cardiovascular:â€¯ Positive for chest pain.\nâ€¢â€¯Gastrointestinal:â€¯ Positive for difficulty swallowing.\nâ€¢â€¯Psychiatric:â€¯ Positive for stress.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\nMild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe patientâ€™s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patientâ€™s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.\n\nNon-cardiac chest pain.\n\nSuspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.\n\nPLAN\n\nâ€¢ We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nâ€¢ Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs.\nâ€¢ Follow up as needed.",

, you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .\n [patient] yeah .\n [doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?\n [patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .\n [doctor] mm-hmm .\n [patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .\n [doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .\n [patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .\n [doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .\n [patient] yeah .\n [doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?\n [patient] yes , i am .\n [doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .\n [patient] okay .\n [doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?\n [patient] nope .\n [doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .\n [patient] okay .\n [doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?\n [patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .\n [doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .\n [patient] mm-hmm .\n [doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .\n [patient] okay .\n [doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?\n [patient] sure , i can do that .\n [doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .\n [patient] okay .\n [doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .\n [patient] mm-hmm .\n [doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .\n [patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .\n [doctor] yeah .\n [patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .\n [doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .\n [patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?\n [doctor] yes .\n [patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .\n [doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .\n [patient] yeah .\n [doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?\n [patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .\n [doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?\n [patient] i am unvaccinated .\n [doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?\n [patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .\n [doctor] correct , we do n't .\n [patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .\n [doctor] right .\n [patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.\n [doctor] okay .\n [patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .\n [doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .\n [patient] okay .\n [doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .\n [patient] yeah .\n [doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .\n [patient] mm-hmm .\n [doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .\n [patient] all of them ?\n [doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?\n [patient] no , i do n't .\n [doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .\n [patient] well , i am open-minded to this .\n [doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .\n [patient] okay .\n [doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .\n [patient] mm-hmm .\n [doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .\n [patient] i understand .\n [doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .\n [patient] well , that's what i'm here for .\n [doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .\n [patient] okay .\n [doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .\n [patient] sure .\n [doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?\n [patient] will do .\n [doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?\n [patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .\n [doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .\n [patient] thanks , you too .\n [doctor] next line heading will be \" acute to chronic constipation \" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis .\n [doctor] i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be \" quadriplegia \" . um , next line and heading will be \" covid vaccine status \" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Transition of care visit.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Michelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.\n \n The patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.\n \n Today, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.\n \n The patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her â€œrespiratory status is limitedâ€. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.\n \n PAST HISTORY\n \n Medical\n Quadriplegia.\n Spinal cord injury.\n Hypertension.\n Chronic constipation.\n Automatic dysreflexia.\n \n CURRENT MEDICATIONS\n \n MiraLAX as needed by mouth.\n Lactulose as needed by mouth.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n â€¢ Acute to chronic constipation.\n â€¢ Quadriplegia.\n \n PLAN\n \n Acute to chronic constipation\n She believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.\n \n COVID vaccine status\n Again, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n Labs pending at the time of discharge have been reviewed. Follow-up labs and appointments have been ordered.",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .\n[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?\n[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?\n[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?\n[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .\n[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?\n[patient] yes , correct .\n[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?\n[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .\n[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?\n[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .\n[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?\n[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .\n[doctor] no kidding , that's great .\n[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .\n[doctor] really ?\n[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .\n[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?\n[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .\n[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?\n[patient] probably about three or four .\n[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .\n[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?\n[patient] i do .\n[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?\n[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .\n[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?\n[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .\n[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?\n[patient] yeah , that's right .\n[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?\n[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .\n[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?\n[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .\n[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?\n[patient] yep , that's correct .\n[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?\n[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .\n[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .\n[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .\n[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .\n[patient] yeah , okay .\n[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?\n[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .\n[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .\n[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .\n[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .\n[patient] all right , that sounds good .\n[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .\n[patient] ahh .\n[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .\n[patient] awesome .\n[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?\n[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .\n[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .\n[patient] yeah i do know that .\n[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting\n[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .\n[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .\n[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .\n[patient] all right\n[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .\n[patient] okay , got it .\n[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?\n[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .\n[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .\n[patient] awesome , thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?\n[patient] i just get it over the counter .\n[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?\n[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .\n[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .\n[patient] okay awesome .\n[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] all right so we've got it .\n[patient] great .\n[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .\n[patient] okay sounds good .\n[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nEmily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.\n\nMrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.\n\nShe hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.\n\nOver the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.\n\nShe notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.\n\nMrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.\n\nShe has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.\n\nThe patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAsthma.\nAllergy rhinitis.\nFood allergies to peanut and tree nuts.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nWixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.\nProair HFA as needed.\nEpiPen as needed.\nAlvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nPeanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.\nMontelukast sodium, â€œseizure-likeâ€ reaction.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAsthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.\nCurrent food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.\nâ€¢ Allergic rhinitis.\nâ€¢ Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.\n\nEmily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.\n\nPLAN\n\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\nThe patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.\n\nAllergic rhinitis\nShe will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.\n\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\nThe patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\nStart Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.\n\nAllergic rhinitis\nContinue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.\n\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\nContinue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.",

abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?\n [patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .\n [doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .\n [patient] yes , that's correct .\n [doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?\n [patient] yeah , that sounds good .\n [doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .\n [patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .\n [doctor] okay .\n [patient] we automatically thought appendix .\n [doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .\n [patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .\n [doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?\n [patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .\n [doctor] okay .\n [patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .\n [doctor] wow . okay .\n [patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .\n [doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?\n [patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .\n [doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?\n [patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .\n [doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .\n [patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .\n [doctor] mhm . okay .\n [patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .\n [doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?\n [patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .\n [doctor] got you . okay .\n [patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .\n [doctor] hmm . okay .\n [patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .\n [doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?\n [patient_guest] only pepcid .\n [doctor] okay .\n [patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .\n [doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?\n [patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .\n [doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?\n [patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .\n [doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?\n [patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .\n [doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?\n [patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .\n [doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .\n [patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .\n [doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .\n [patient_guest] you're welcome .\n [doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?\n [patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .\n [doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .\n [patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .\n [doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?\n [patient_guest] correct . yep .\n [doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .\n [patient_guest] yes .\n [doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?\n [patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .\n [doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?\n [patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .\n [doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?\n [patient] no , not that i've noticed .\n [doctor] okay .\n [patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .\n [doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-\n [patient_guest] okay .\n [doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .\n [patient_guest] okay .\n [doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?\n [patient] okay .\n [doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .\n [patient_guest] okay .\n [doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .\n [patient_guest] okay . thank you .\n [doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .\n [patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .\n [doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?\n [patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .\n [doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .\n [patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .\n [doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .\n [patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .\n [doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .\n [patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .\n [doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .\n [patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .\n [doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .\n [patient_guest] you too .\n [doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?\n [patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?\n [doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .\n [patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .\n [doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-\n [patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .\n [doctor] not because of it . okay .\n [patient] yeah .\n [doctor] i see what you're saying .\n [patient] yeah .\n [doctor] got it . cool . i'm gon na stop-",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Next patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\n \n The father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had \"a lot of infections\". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.\n \n Prior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.\n \n When the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.\n \n The patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.\n \n SOCIAL HISTORY\n \n The patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.\n \n FAMILY HISTORY\n \n Paternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.\n Paternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.\n \n No family history of polycystic kidney disease.\n \n CURRENT MEDICATIONS\n \n Pepcid 40 mg once daily.\n Claritin as needed for allergies.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n Constitutional\n Well-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.\n \n Neurological\n Alert.\n \n RESULTS\n \n Abdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.\n CT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.\n CMP, 03/22/2021.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n â€¢ Renal hypoplasia.\n Ashley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 mÂ², and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.\n \n PLAN\n \n Yearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.\n \n The patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n Schedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician.",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRenal screening tests.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nKatherine Lopez is a 22-month-old female, born at 34 weeks +3 days gestation, diagnosed with the rare Smith-Magenis syndrome and associated global developmental delays. She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cowâ€™s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where â€œthe kidneys fuse into oneâ€ and issues with their legs.\n\nThe patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates â€œa lotâ€. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cowâ€™s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses. The mom states that Katherine is shorter and seems chubbier related to her syndrome. She also has a 9-year-old brother who is diagnosed with autism.\n\nBIRTH HISTORY\n\nTwin gestation.

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n \n Numbness and tingling of both hands.\n \n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n \n Elijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands.\n \n The patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began in 12/2019 after he broke both wrists in a motor vehicle accident and which has progressively worsened since then. He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems \"dull\". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given \"nerve pain medicineâ€ but has not been taking it.\n \n He currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes. He denies any history of thyroid issues.\n \n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n \n â€¢ Constitutional Symptoms: Easily fatigued, weight gain.\n â€¢ Eyes: Floaters.\n â€¢ Cardiovascular: Bilateral peripheral edema.\n â€¢ Respiratory: Shortness of breath.\n â€¢ Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, abdominal bloating.\n â€¢ Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.\n â€¢ Integumentary: Dry itchy skin, nail bed changes.\n â€¢ Endocrine: Excessive hunger.\n \n PHYSICAL EXAM\n \n Neurological\n Pinprick sensation intact in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right hand and 4th and 5th fingers on the left hand. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes down going bilaterally. Tinelâ€™s sign positive at both wrists and elbows.\n \n ASSESSMENT\n \n â€¢ Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome\n Mr. Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands. His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.\n \n PLAN\n \n Diagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling. Further testing is indicated to measure the responsiveness of the nerves to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We will plan for a follow-up visit after the EMG testing is performed. If still symptomatic, we can consider a referral to our Hand Clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery. We could also refer to an orthopedist for the same treatment.\n \n INSTRUCTIONS\n \n Follow-up after EMG testing.",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nPituitary lesion.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBruce Ward is a 52-year-old male with a pituitary lesion. The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention.\n\nThe patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.\n\nMr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.\n\nThe patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nNewly diagnosed pituitary lesion.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo known family history; adopted.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployment Status: Works as a computer programmer.\nMarital Status: Married for 25 years.\nLiving Arrangement: Lives with wife, recently purchased a new house.\nAlcohol Use: None.\nTobacco Use: Non-smoker.\nRecreational Drugs: None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological\nPatient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.\n\nEyes\nVisual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.\n\nRESULTS\n\nLabs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal.\n\nIndependent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Pituitary adenoma\nâ€¢ Bitemporal hemianopia\n\nMr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.\n\nPLAN\n\nPituitary adenoma.\nWe discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.\n\nBitemporal hemianopia.\nWe will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nâ€¢ Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing.\nâ€¢ Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.\n",

years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .\n[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?\n[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .\n[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .\n[patient] uh , not that i recall .\n[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .\n[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .\n[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?\n[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .\n[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .\n[patient] yeah , i guess .\n[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .\n[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?\n[patient_guest] no , not at all .\n[doctor] and how about cognition ?\n[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .\n[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said \" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , \"\n[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?\n[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .\n[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?\n[patient] ca n't say that i have .\n[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .\n[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .\n[patient] so what does that mean ?\n[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .\n[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?\n[doctor] yep , that's right .\n[patient] i do have a question for you though .\n[doctor] yeah , of course .\n[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?\n[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .\n[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.\n\nI have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.\n\nMr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said â€œI feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.â€ Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nUrinary incontinence.\nAdult hydrocephalus.\nGait impairment.\nCognitive impairment.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nâ€¢ Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.\nâ€¢ Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.\nâ€¢ Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.\nâ€¢ Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nMr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.\n\nHead and Face\nThe shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.\n\nNeurological\nMental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.\nGait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.\nCranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.\nMotor: Normal for bulk and strength.\nCoordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Adult hydrocephalus.\nâ€¢ Gait impairment.\nâ€¢ Urinary incontinence and urgency.\nâ€¢ Cognitive impairment.\n\nMr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.\n\nMr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.\n\nPLAN\n\nI had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow up in 3 months.",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] donna torres , date of birth 8/1/1980 . hi donna , how are you ? [patient] i'm good , how about you ? [doctor] i'm doing well , thank you and so i saw that doctor brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ? [patient] no , that's new . [doctor] okay . how is it working for you ? [patient] my anxiety's going good now . thankfully , i'm serious . it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like i can not do this . i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety , so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what . [doctor] hmmm okay . [patient] and i would start usually during the day at work . [doctor] i see . [patient] i mean i'm fine now . [doctor] well , that's good that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you were dealing with is hormonal and that's why i was asking because you were on the progesterone and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too . [patient] i did . [doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone . [patient] yes . [doctor] so i know we started for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also . [patient] yeah , and before in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof , which then i knew my period was coming , then it turned into my anxiety spiking , just at random times . [doctor] hmmm okay . [patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason . [doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time . [patient] yes . [doctor] alright , so not really a link there , alright . [patient] yeah , i do n't know . [doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too . [patient] i figured maybe that's what it was . [doctor] and we did go through the go live in november and december so that can be pretty stressful also . [patient] yeah and that worked and that's when i first started to leave the process of delivering the results to patients with covid in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait 9 days before they get their results and then we open the evaluation centers and the covid clinic , so i think it just took a toll on me . [doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that . [patient] yeah and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines i mean i was supporting people sure but i was n't in the icu so i felt selfish and guilty i mean hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was having anxiety and it's not ridiculous . [doctor] well , honestly you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so but let's see , i need to just put this dax back to work . alright . so no other issues whatsoever ? [patient] no . [doctor] have you lost weight ? [patient] no , when i stopped taking the camilla birth control , my hunger level was at a new high . i mean i was eating constantly . i felt like what was going on . [doctor] alright . [patient] and now i am feeling better . [doctor] okay . that's good . and your mask face though , it does look thinner . [patient] well , in the past 6 months , i have lost some weight . [doctor] okay , good . anything else going on ? [patient] no . [doctor] alright . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative , negative . have you ever had an abnormal pap ? [patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 and then i had to be seen every 6 months for a while and then i had a normal pap . [doctor] alright , well let's just repeat it then . [patient] yeah , that's fine with me to be safe . [doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under and the potential for getting covid , or the vaccine , i have actually seen some an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while , so that's why i figure let's just check . [patient] okay . and i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it , same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad and how will it impact her when she gets older . [doctor] have you had the vaccine ? [patient] yes , i have and so has my son , he has had his first already . [doctor] okay , well , you know you can only do what you can do . [patient] yeah , i agree . [doctor] alright , well , let's complete your exam . [patient] alright . [doctor] so let's take a deep breath , and again alright you can breathe normally . [patient] alright and take one more deep breath , [doctor] okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect and just place your hand above your head okay , i do feel some little bumps . [patient] yeah , but they are not as big as they were . [doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast , it does feel a little bit denseer . does it hurt at all ? [patient] it does where your left hand just was . [doctor] okay , right here ? [patient] yeah , down here , but whenever i breast-fed , it was always sore there too , i had a clog and something else , the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there unfortunately . [doctor] yeah , they are , well now i do n't know because if it was the progesterone , they would have gone away . [patient] yeah . [doctor] alright , well just let your knees just relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ? [patient] yes and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever . [doctor] okay . [patient] but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help . [doctor] okay , great . alright , looks good . [patient] good . [doctor] you can go ahead and sit up . [patient] thank you . [doctor] alright , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now . [patient] okay . and what could that mean ? [doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there is also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cyst . and lumps and fibroadenomas . those are all benign things . they are annoying and requires some work-up , but they are all benign . [patient] and i'm , i'm just worried because i'm almost full . 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer , so i mean i know there is nothing i can do about it but it's just i feel like we had it under control and now it is n't . [doctor] well i would n't say that . i mean i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before and things actually have n't changed . [patient] yeah . [doctor] so those are all good things . [patient] okay . [doctor] because if it was cancer , it would actually we would see some change . [patient] it would , okay . thank you for explaining that . [doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing . but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue and it's annoying that we have to follow them . [patient] yeah , i agree there . [doctor] but the only extra that i could potentially do is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam in the office to check out , check it out on their own . they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier if they think it needs if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than you know like radiology is to biopsy it . [patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should . [doctor] alright . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule . [patient] okay , i think that sounds great . [doctor] alright , i do too . alright , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ? [patient] no , i think i'm all set . [doctor] alright , good . alright , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else . [patient] alright , thank you . you have a good day too . [doctor] alright .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up bilateral breast cysts.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDonna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.\n\nThe patient reports continual presence of â€œlumpsâ€ in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.\n\nHer last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.\n\nMrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating â€œit was brutalâ€ and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.\n\nThe patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.\n\nGynecologic History\nLast pap smear: 2019.\nHistory of abnormal pap smear: 2009.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nBilateral breast cysts.\nAnxiety.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployed in healthcare, supports Covid evaluation centers and clinics.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMother, deceased age 45, from complications of breast cancer.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nBuspar.\nSingulair.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGenitourinary\nBreast: Breast density.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.\nâ€¢ Pap smear.\n\nPLAN\n\nFollow-up bilateral breast cysts\nPhysical exam indicated stable breast density bilaterally.

[patient] her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 mm lesion which was located on the right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma . [doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you . [patient] likewise , wish you were under better circumstances . [doctor] yeah , i heard your dermatologist sent you to because she found the melanoma . [patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said . [doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ? [patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month . [doctor] i see and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10 to get it checked out , right ? [patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family . [doctor] well i'm really glad you took a serious and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ? [patient] my mom and her sister i think they both had melanoma . [doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family like breast or ovarian ? [patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer . [doctor] okay and what about your mom or dad's father ? [patient] mother's . [doctor] okay and have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ? [patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year . my physical and has n't said he is concerned about any of them before . [doctor] good , good . let's go over your medical history here in your chart . i have that you are not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you are allergic to augmentin , is that right ? [patient] yes , that's correct . [doctor] okay and for social history , can you tell me what you do for work ? [patient] i own an auto repair shop . okay and have you ever been a smoker ? yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying . [doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . what about your surgical history ? have you had any surgeries ? [patient] i had gallbladder and appendix . [doctor] okay , great . we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been ? any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ? [patient] no , i've been feeling great . [doctor] good . well , let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind . [patient] sure . [doctor] okay . i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon , what i'm seeing here so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ? [patient] okay , that's fine . [doctor] alright , so on the right inferior back , there is a 1 cm shave biopsy site including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation there is no intrinsic or satellite lesions . no other suspicious moles . no axillary , cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin but it's nontender . otherwise normal exam . [patient] okay , you can sit up . so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . [doctor] i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing . and you know make sure it's something we need to worry about the reason we are being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further . [patient] okay . i should have worried too much then . [doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal . the treatment for your melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 mm or less and that's what we recommend and yours was exactly 0.7 mm . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery , but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision . [patient] okay , that is fine with me . i ca n't see back there anyways . [doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it as it heals . but since we're we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you wan na check in with me or have any problems , however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly , so she can monitor you . your dermatologist will check if this one does n't come back , but she will also check for other lesions that look suspicious . unfortunately since you had one melanoma , you are at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else . [patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back . [doctor] good and i'm sure she has already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight . [patient] yeah , she definitely went over that several times with me . [doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . we'll get you set up for the ultrasound and the procedure . do you have any questions for me ? [patient] no , i ca n't think of any at this time . [doctor] okay . my nurse will be in to get you scheduled . so sit tight . it was very good to meet you . [patient] thank you . nice to meet you as well . [doctor] please add the following pathology to results a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive superficial spreading , histology , superficial spreading . clark level iv , breslow thickness 0.7 mm , radial growth phase present , vertical growth phase not identified , mitotic features less than 1 mmÂ² , ulceration not identified , regression not identified , [patient] lymphatic invasion not identified . perineural invasion not identified , microscopic satellitosis not identified , infiltrating lymphocytes , breast , [doctor] melanocytic nevus not identified , predominant cytology , epithelioid , peripheral margin positive , deep margin negative , stage i . also note that i reviewed the dermatologist photo of the lesion , which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central asmelanotic component and a regular border . for assessment and plan , the patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma . biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma . on examination today , there is right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency .

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nMelanoma.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nSophia Jackson is a very pleasant 57-year-old female who presents for a surgical consult for melanoma of the right inferior back. She was referred by her dermatologist who biopsied the 0.7 mm lesion on 04/10 and diagnosed the melanoma. The lesion was initially noticed by the patientâ€™s mother when she was visiting her last month. Mrs. Jackson denies a personal history of atypical nevi and reports that she has annual mole checks by her primary care provider at her physicals. She has never seen a dermatologist prior to last month. There is a family history of melanoma in her mother and maternal aunt. The patient reports that she has been in her usual state of health with no unintentional weight changes, headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or vision changes.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nNone reported.\n\nSurgical\nCholecystectomy.\nAppendectomy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient owns an auto repair shop.\nCurrent smoker since teens. Actively trying to quit.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMother: melanoma.\nMaternal aunt: melanoma.\nMaternal grandfather: pancreatic cancer.\nNo family history of breast or ovarian cancers.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nNone.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nAugmentin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nHematologic/lymphatics: No axillary, cervical, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. There is a soft lymph node in the right groin. Nontender.\nSkin: On the right inferior back there is a 1 cm shave biopsy site including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation. Thereâ€™s no intrinsic or satellite lesions. No other suspicious moles.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPathology Report.\n\nPathology: Shave biopsy of right inferior back malignant melanoma, invasive, superficial spreading.\nHistology: Superficial spreading.\nClark level: 4.\nBreslow thickness: 0.7 mm.\nRadial growth phase: present.\nVertical growth phase: not identified.\nMitotic figures: less than 1 mm2.\nUlceration: not identified.\nRegression: not identified.\nLymphatic invasion: not identified.\nPerineural invasion: not identified.\nMicroscopic satellitosis: not identified.\nInfiltrating lymphocytes: breast.\nMelanocytic nevus: not identified.\nPredominant cytology: epithelioid.\nPeripheral margin: positive.\nDeep margin: Negative.\nStage: 1.\n\nI reviewed the dermatologistâ€™s photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central amelanotic component and irregular border.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nThe patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma. The biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma. On examination today, there is a right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency. I recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. If the ultrasound is normal, the patient is a candidate for a wide local excision with a 1-2 cm margin. Primary closure should be possible, but skin graft closure may be needed. The relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed. The need for follow up according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines was reviewed. We also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance, skin self-examination, and the ABCDEâ€™s of mole surveillance. After discussing the procedure, risks, expected outcomes and possible complications, questions were answered, and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed.",

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] this is philip gutierrez date of birth 1/12/1971 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . [patient] he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 pulley region , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . [doctor] he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of fds tendon end . [patient] he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr pa at that institution . at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 . [doctor] which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint partial thickness tear of the right fds and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact . his x-rays four views of the right hand today show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand . no soft tissue shadows of concern . no arthritis . hi , how are you mr . gutierrez ? i'm good how about you ? [patient] well how can i help you today ? so i was a passenger in a car that was rear-ended and we were hit multiple times i felt two bumps which slugged me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger . [doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ? [patient] i do n't really know , i just felt like it felt like i laid on my finger and so i felt like it went back and it's been hurting since about march and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened , so i and i ca n't make a fist but sometimes the pain is unbearable and like even driving hurts . [doctor] okay . so this was march of this year , so maybe about 3 months ago ? [patient] yeah . and it's still swollen . so i was seeing an orthopedist and they sent me to an occupational therapist and i've been doing therapy with them and then they sent me to go back and get an mri , so i went and got the mri then they told me that the mri came back . and i said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection because the injection was going to make the tear worse . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] and then after he got the mri he said that i have a tear in my finger and that he did n't want to do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there and then the occupational therapy says it's because of the tear , and then they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing and doing things with my hand , so i feel like i'm not getting medical care really . [doctor] hmmm yeah , i see that . [patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand because i am right handed and i kinda need that hand . [doctor] mm-hmm what do you do for a living ? [patient] i'm an x-ray tech . [doctor] wow so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ? [patient] nope . do you take any chronic medications of significance ? [doctor] i do take a blood pressure pill and that's it . [patient] okay and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methyl prednisone ? [doctor] that's correct . alright , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . alright , so lean over here . alright , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse . no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger . normal creases , slightly diminished over the tip of the index finger compared to the middle finger . [patient] his index finger rest in a 10 degree pip flexed position alright , is that uncomfortable to correct that and is it uncomfortable now here ? [doctor] yeah when you push on it , yeah . [patient] alright , how about here ? there it's not . [doctor] okay , not as bad . [patient] yeah , it feels little numb . [doctor] gotcha , alright , bend , bend the tip of this finger , bend it as hard as you can , keep bending , keep bending , alright , straighten it out , [patient] alright , and now bend it for me as best you can . my goodness , feels like it's it's tearing in there . okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger and bend it as hard as you can , keep bending , alright , straighten that out and now bend it for me as best as you can , [doctor] alright , good . now bend that finger and i'm going to pull , put it down like this and then bend that finger for me , okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? alright , now make a fist , great , so relax the finger , alright , so just keep it , keep when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand , is that okay there ? [patient] ow , ah . [doctor] okay , okay , so all the hurt it seems is stretching because you have n't been doing this for so long , so you know what i mean so you're going to have to start really doing that . [patient] well , i've tried , i even bought myself a splint . [doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you , it actually immobilizes you . [patient] okay , i thought it would straighten it out . [doctor] no , no , so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me as hard as you can and keep going , going , alright , so , so you're okay . alright , so i would say the following that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds the flexor digitorum , superficialis which is the least important of the two . [patient] okay . [doctor] now there are two halves of it , so it's the partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important and the other one is just fine . so the good one is good ? [patient] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] yeah , so you know i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon , [doctor] blocking excursion of these other tendons that they ca n't get through to the pulley . [patient] okay . alright . [doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection and i would avoid the dexamethasone because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone which is a sellastone i've gotten another methylprednisolone and that itching like crazy . [patient] did it , yeah , this one is water soluble and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger . [doctor] alright , we'll give it a try . good . so you do the shot and it's going to take about 3 to 5 days before it starts feeling better and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better . [patient] perfect . [doctor] alright , so take advantage of that . you got ta start moving the finger . you're not gon na tear anything or break a bone because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you got a sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part and then you have to do all the stiff part . [patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up . [doctor] hmmm okay . so it was injured and you had scar tissue and then you had posttraumatic inflammation and so this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable to where you can make some gains and we actually might need to repeat this as well . [patient] well i'll be able to drive , i drove myself here today so . [doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive . okay , good . [patient] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a posttraumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger . [doctor] and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so mr . gutierrez , do you have therapy scheduled or set up ? [patient] not at the moment . [doctor] alright , well , i mean you know that you need to move that finger and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so , i want you to move that finger finger , but i think it would be beneficial for you to have an accountability . [patient] so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody . [doctor] okay that's kinda why i'm here for you , tell me what needs to be done , you know . [patient] yeah , so i'll write you out , [doctor] an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient , once a week for 6 weeks , [patient] and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions . [doctor] alright sounds like a plan . [patient] alright , well i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure and we'll and i'll be back shortly . [doctor] thanks document . right trigger finger injection template , attempted to inject 1 cc of celestone with half a cc of lidocaine however , the patient had a dramatic and violent , painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1 cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . [patient] a small palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger . recommended icing and it this evening and taking ibuprofen .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight index finger hyperextension injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.\n\nIn summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the \"FDS tendon.\"\n\nThe patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.\n\nThe patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.\n\nMs. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployed as x-ray technician.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nMethylprednisolone causes itching.\nDexamethasone causes palpitations.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nâ€¢ Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.\nâ€¢ Endocrine: Denies diabetes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nVery pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.\n\nNeurological\nGrossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.\n\nCardiovascular\nRegular rate and rhythm.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nExam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.\n\nMRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.\n\nMs. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.\n\nPLAN\n\nThe patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.\n\nTreatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.\n\nThe patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nRight index trigger finger injection.\nThe patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nOccupational therapy as prescribed.\n",

    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight hip pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nElizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes â€œcatchâ€ when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.\n\nStarting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers.

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] dictating on donald clark date of birth 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ? [patient] good morning . [doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller . [patient] it's nice to meet you as well . [doctor] so i hear you are having pain in this arm , is that correct ? [patient] that's correct . [doctor] okay and it seems like it's worse at night ? [patient] well right now the hand is . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] and the thing started about 2 weeks ago , i woke up about 2:00 in the morning and it was just hurting something awful . [doctor] uh uh . [patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up . [doctor] okay , that's good . [patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down thinking it would like help the circulation , but it did n't . [doctor] okay , i see . [patient] and so after a while when it eased off maybe about four or 5 am i laid back down and it did n't start up again . [doctor] mm-hmm okay . [patient] i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened like over and over , so i finally went to see the doctor and i do n't really recall her name . [doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about though . [patient] she is the one who sent me to you , so i , i would , i would think so , but when i went to her after the third time it happened , then she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve , [doctor] probably do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ? [patient] no . [doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ? [patient] some days if it bothers me at night , then the day following it usually will bother me some . [doctor] okay and do you just notice it in the hand or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ? [patient] well it starts there and goes all the way down the arm . [doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay like in terms of gripping things ? [patient] yeah . [doctor] okay . [patient] this finger i hurt it sometime ago as well . [doctor] really ? [patient] yeah , it does n't work properly or it works very rarely . [doctor] gotcha and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids or ? [patient] well she gave me some numbing medicine , it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin , [doctor] you should have a full list in your notes though since then it has n't really bothered me at night also just see now i am a va and him 1 % disabled from this leg issues from the knees down to my feet okay is it neuropathy gotcha , that is good to know . alright , well , let's go ahead and take a look . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , so to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good and now go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay and now come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way great and now as far as you can towards that wall , does not seem to bother you at all now well actually i do feel little strain okay so you feel it in the neck a little bit yet is a little strain okay now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands great now hold your arms like this . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i'm going to try to straighten your arms and try and keep them as stiff as you can , do n't let me straighten it . okay , good , good . now when i am just touching your hands like this , does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay . alright so i do agree with betty more than likely this seems like it would be coming from your neck that's the most common reason that causes what what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now what i do n't have is an mri which would show me kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off . [patient] i see . [doctor] so gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural and what that is is it it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine excuse me , that works behind the nerve roots , that nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms and i do need to get an mri of your neck . i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see . right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . what do you think of that ? [patient] i think that sounds good to me . [doctor] okay , good and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list . [patient] no , i do n't . [doctor] okay good and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin are you taking 300 or 100 ? [patient] i'm not sure my lady friend helps me handle this stuff . [doctor] okay . [patient] i am taking eliquis though . [doctor] okay so whatever you are doing , you can just keep doing it and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study just so i know right up with the medicine and i will follow up with you after that and we can do the shot just to make sure your arm is feeling better sound good . [patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights though my neck has not been bothering me . [doctor] okay so presumably what's happening then is when you're sleeping , your neck is kinda gets off tilt tilter and it compresses the nerve roots there . now if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on because probably this is something that will likely flare up again . [patient] yeah it it has been for the last week , so i understand . okay , alright , well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural or do you think you're doing fine and do you wan na wait ? well my hand is still bothering me . okay . so you're saying your neck is not bothering you , but the hand is . okay , so then let's just stick with the plan . [doctor] mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots maybe compressed that's giving your hand the issue and then we are going to set you up with the epidural . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] alright , so keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand and then we will follow up afterwards . [patient] alright , is the mri today ? [doctor] you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can . alright . [patient] alright , well , it was nice meeting you my friend . [doctor] you as well , thank you . physical exam , elderly white gentleman presents in a wheelchair , no apparent distress per the template down through neurologic , 1+ bilateral biceps , triceps , brachioradialis , reflexes bilateral , all negative . follow up and take out the lower extremities . gait not assessed today . strength and sensation is per the template . upper and lower extremities , musculoskeletal , he is nontender over his cervical spine . he does have mildly restricted cervical extension , right and left lateral rotation which is symmetric which gives him mild lateral neck pain , but no radic radicular pain . spurling's maneuver is benign . paragraph , diagnostics , cervical x-rays 6/4/2021 . cervical x-ray reveals significant disc degeneration at c5-6 and to a lower extent c4-5 and c3-4 . significant lower lumbar facet arthropathy c6-7 and c7-t1 is difficult to visualize in the current x-rays . paragraph , impression , # 1 , left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radiculopathy , possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy . # 2 , neck pain in the setting of arthritis , disc degeneration . paragraph , plan , i suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy . i'm going to set him up for a cervical mri and we'll tentatively plan for a left c7-t1 epidural afterwards , although the exact location will be pending the mri results . he'll continue his home exercise program as well as twice a day gabapentin . we'll follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief . he denies any blood thinners .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft arm pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nHe reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.\n\nThe pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.\n\nMr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating â€œit rarely worksâ€, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPeripheral neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nGabapentin tablet.\nPrednisone tablet.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nElderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.\n\nNeurologic\nUpper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's\nGait: Not assessed today.\n\nStrength\nUpper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.\nSensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nCervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.\nImpression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy\nâ€¢ Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation\n\nPLAN\n\nI suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.\n\nThis plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nContinue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.",

you like .\n[patient_guest] all right . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .\n[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .\n[patient_guest] okay . okay .\n[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .\n[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .\n[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .\n[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?\n[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .\n[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .\n[doctor] yes , zarbee's .\n[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?\n[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] right , does that make sense ?\n[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .\n[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .\n[patient_guest] right , okay .\n[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .\n[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?\n[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , \" as needed , \" or anything like that .\n[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome .\n[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?\n[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .\n[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .\n[patient_guest] okay . okay .\n[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .\n[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .\n[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?\n[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .\n[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .\n[doctor] you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .",

He is irritable and having trouble falling asleep, described â€œlike he is fighting itâ€.\n\nThe patient has been exposed to an older sister who is sick and a cousin who has a sinus infection.\n\nTreatment has included saline nasal spray, Tylenol, baby Vick's, and a humidifier. When the patient aroused this morning, he was warm to the touch. When his sleeper was removed, he was quite sweaty despite the air conditioner being on.\n\nThe patient's dandruff is also worsening.

    "originalDialogue": "[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .\n[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?\n[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?\n[patient] yes . that's right .\n[doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?\n[patient] no , i have n't .\n[doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay . that sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um-\n[patient] thank you .\n[doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay . that's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .\n[patient] right .\n[doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .\n[patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .\n[doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .\n[patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .\n[doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .\n[patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .\n[doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .\n[patient] yeah , okay .\n[doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .\n[patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .\n[doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .\n[patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .\n[doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .\n[patient] yeah , okay .\n[doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?\n[patient] no , not really .\n[doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .\n[patient] good . i look forward to a relief .\n[doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .\n[patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .\n[doctor] okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .\n[patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .\n[doctor] that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia ,

There is no nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally. No breast tenderness, masses, or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Macromastia.\n\nJulia Jones is a 25-year-old female with symptomatic macromastia presenting for evaluation of breast reduction. The patient has attempted non-surgical treatments with minimal relief and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Her minimum required resection based on a BSA of 2.65 with the Schnur scale is 1792 g, which should be attainable. Given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above, there is potential for using a free nipple graft.\n\nPLAN\n\nAn extensive discussion of breast reduction surgery was performed with the patient with consideration of the patient's age, co-morbidities, previous surgical history, body habitus, BMI, and smoking history. Surgical time, immediate recovery course, and longer term recovery course were discussed. Relief of the patient's current symptoms related to macromastia was not guaranteed though is expected to improve. Specific breast size was discussed, also not guaranteed. I explained the expected outcomes of using a free nipple graft such as an insensate nipple and an inability to breast feed. The patient understands that the decision for a free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on assessment of nipple perfusion.\n\nRisks and benefits of were discussed with the patient The patient understands the above risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammaplasty.\n\nThe patient will be switching to a different insurance policy in 07/2021. Once we get the new insurance information from the patient, we will submit it to her insurance company. If approved, she will return for preoperative counseling and consent.\n\nReturn to clinic prior to scheduled surgery date for preoperative counseling and consent.",

and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?\n[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?\n[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .\n[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .\n[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?\n[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .\n[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .\n[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .\n[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .\n[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?\n[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?\n[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .\n[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?\n[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .\n[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .\n[patient] all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .\n[doctor] yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .\n[doctor] fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others . verbal consent was attained . the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications . post-procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .",

He notes when he stands after he has been sitting for a while, he has to use a cane to \"get his bearings.\" The injection he received to the right knee at the last visit was only beneficial for a few weeks. The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not attended physical therapy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLower right extremity: Swollen right knee, slightly reduced range of motion. Skin warm to touch. Lower right leg pits with pressure.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nFluid aspiration and Steroid injection.\nRisks, benefits, and alternatives were explained. The risks of steroid injection were explained, including but not limited to, hypopigmentation, soft tissue atrophy, tendon ruptures, and transient hyperglycemia among others. Verbal consent was obtained. The right knee was accessed through the lateral approach with 3 mL of initially clear fluid then blood-tinged fluid. Then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion. The right knee was injected with 80 mg triamcinolone and 1 mL lidocaine. The procedure was tolerated well with no complications. Post procedure instructions were given.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Rheumatoid arthritis management.\nâ€¢ High risk medication use.\nâ€¢ Right knee pain.\nâ€¢ Lower extremity pitting edema.\n\nPLAN\n\nRheumatoid arthritis management.\nThe patient will continue Xeljanz XR 11 mg daily.

Pain at the time was 8 out of 10 on a scale of 10. she currently denies any flank pain.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nAlavert 10 mg tablet once daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGenitourinary: Normal vaginal exam.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRenal Ultrasound\nImpression: Right kidney is 10 cm in length by 5 cm wide.

[doctor] hey , how are you today ? [patient] alright , how you been ? [doctor] i'm good . [patient] good , good . [doctor] have you lost some weight or you at least putting on some muscle , you look trump . [patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been . [doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt , makes you look then . [patient] yeah , i guess that's it . [doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ? [patient] good , the testosterone is going well . [doctor] that's great . [patient] helped me out , i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects , not so much physically because like i said , i've i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my blood work . [doctor] okay , well , that's good . [patient] so the finasteride i am only taking half a pill , it's the 5 mg one . [doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that . [patient] and cialis on the days i work out , i take 5 mg , otherwise i take 2-1/2 mg pills , but i have been out of it . [doctor] okay . [patient] but overall i'm doing well . i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together . [doctor] good . it's always great to hear . let's look i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs . [patient] okay . [doctor] please use my general exam template alright just take a few breaths . [patient] okay . [doctor] now . alright everything sounds good , no concerns there . [patient] great . so i wanted to show you something . [doctor] sure . [patient] look at this . [doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol . [patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 mg/dl , then i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th . [doctor] right . [patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers . [doctor] wow , that's remarkable . [patient] this is the test , it's the only change . i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this i mean there is a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement meaning those who get good levels of their tests see their diabetic control improve . [doctor] yeah . but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless we will take it . [patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping . [doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference . [patient] 145 mg/dl from 265 mg/dl is awesome . i also read that it it's cardioprotective . [doctor] absolutely . [patient] my red blood cell count has increased . [doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though . [patient] stable . [doctor] your psa a today is also is good also . it's 0.6 i think . [patient] yeah is it ? [doctor] yeah , it was 0.5 last year and anything under four is good . [patient] nice , such good news . [doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so . [patient] so in terms of estrogen control , i've been hearing that indol three carbonal or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ? yeah , i've heard of it , but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean your levels are fine and we checked your estradiol and it was not elevated , so . okay . [doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do anymore tests anymore than test once a year , excuse me . [patient] okay . what about increasing my testosterone to 175 mg . i'm at 140 now . [doctor] well , your levels are high . [patient] are they right now ? [doctor] well , i mean they were last time . [patient] yeah , but i just just injected though where i had right before that was taken . [doctor] i know , i know you had then . when did you inject this time ? [patient] i figured i'm on my eighth day today . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday . [doctor] alright . [patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and teas on it , that helps me . [doctor] that's a great idea . so look the biggest issue i've seen even if your levels today are around 700 is that your peaks are getting greater than 1500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness and your risk will only go up the higher the dose that we go on . [patient] okay . [doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you are feeling well . [patient] yeah , i'm feeling good . [doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you are feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean i get it , and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses and then they would have a heart attack at 50 . [patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot . [doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone but still . [patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time . [doctor] true but right now i would not change your dose . [patient] okay . [doctor] makes sense ? [patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion . [doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ? [patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride . [doctor] okay . [patient] i would prefer the paper prescription . [doctor] for all of them ? [patient] sure . [doctor] alright , we will do . let me go get your prescriptions . [patient] okay , thank you .",
    "originalNote": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHypogonadism.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patientâ€™s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.\n\nThe patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.\n\nCurrently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.\n\nMr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life \"together.\" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHIV\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nUtilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.\nActively trying to get his life together.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nCialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.\nFinasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.\nTestosterone cypionate 140 mg.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPSA 0.6 ng/mL.\nTriglycerides 145 mg/dL.\nTotal testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nâ€¢ Hypogonadism.\n\nPLAN\n\nI recommend maintaining current management. The patientâ€™s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and itâ€™s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.\n\nI provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.\n",
